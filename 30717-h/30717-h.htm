<p>Transcribed from the 1893 Jarrold &amp; Sons edition by David
Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org</p>
<h2><i>PRESS NOTICES OF THE FIRST EDITION</i>.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We cordially recommend Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s
book to all who wish to pass an agreeable hour and to learn
something of the outward actions and inner life of their
predecessors.&nbsp; It is full of sketches of East Anglian
celebrities, happily touched if lightly
limned.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>East Anglian Daily Times</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very entertaining and enjoyable book.&nbsp; Local
gossip, a wide range of reading and industrious research, have
enabled the author to enliven his pages with a wide diversity of
subjects, specially attractive to East Anglians, but also of much
general interest.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The work is written in a light gossipy style, and by
reason both of it and of the variety of persons introduced is
interesting.&nbsp; To a Suffolk or Norfolk man it is, of course,
especially attractive.&nbsp; The reader will go through these
pages without being wearied by application.&nbsp; They form a
pleasant and entertaining contribution to county literature, and
&ldquo;East Anglia&rdquo; will, we should think, find its way to
many of the east country bookshelves.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Suffolk
Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The book is as readable and attractive a volume of
local chronicles as could be desired.&nbsp; Though all of our
readers may not see &ldquo;eye to eye&rdquo; with Mr. Ritchie, in
regard to political and theological questions, they cannot fail
to gain much enjoyment from his excellent delineation of old days
in East Anglia.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Norwich Mercury</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;East Anglia&rdquo; has the merit of not being a
compilation, which is more than can be said of the great majority
of books produced in these days to satisfy the revived taste for
topographical gossip.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie is a Suffolk
man&mdash;the son of a Nonconformist minister of Wrentham in that
county&mdash;and he looks back to the old neighbourhood and the
old times with an affection which is likely to communicate itself
to its readers.&nbsp; Altogether we can with confidence recommend
this book not only to East Anglians, but to all readers who have
any affinity for works of its class.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Daily
News</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s book belongs to a class of which we
have none too many, for when well done they illustrate
contemporary history in a really charming manner.&nbsp; What with
their past grandeur, their present progress, their martyrs,
patriots, and authors, there is plenty to tell concerning Eastern
counties: and one who writes with native enthusiasm is sure to
command an audience.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Baptist</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ritchie, known to the numerous readers of the
<i>Christian World</i> as &ldquo;Christopher Crayon,&rdquo; has
the pen of a ready, racy, refreshing writer.&nbsp; He never
writes a dull line, and never for a moment allows our interest to
flag.&nbsp; In the work before us, which is not his first, he is,
I should think, at his best.&nbsp; The volume is the outcome of
extensive reading, many rambles over the districts described, and
of thoughtful observation.&nbsp; We seem to live and move and
have our being in East Anglia.&nbsp; Its folk-lore, its
traditions, its worthies, its memorable events, are all vividly
and charmingly placed before us, and we close the book sorry that
there is no more of it, and wondering why it is that works of a
similar kind have not more frequently
appeared.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Northern Pioneer</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has yielded us more gratification than any work that
we have read for a considerable time.&nbsp; The book ought to
have a wide circulation in the Eastern counties, and will not
fail to yield profit and delight wherever it finds its
way.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Essex Telegraph</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ritchie has here written a most attractive chapter
of autobiography.&nbsp; He recalls the scenes of his early days,
and whatever was quaint or striking in connection with them, and
finds in his recollections ready pegs on which to hang historical
incident and antiquarian curiosities of many kinds.&nbsp; He
passes from point to point in a delightfully cheerful and
contagious mood.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s reading has been as
extensive and careful as his observation is keen and his temper
genial; and his pages, which appeared in <i>The Christian World
Magazine</i>, well deserve the honour of book-form, with the
additions he has been able to make to
them.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

v</span>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
<p>The chapters of which this little work consists originally
appeared in the <i>Christian World Magazine</i>, where they were
so fortunate as to attract favourable notice, and from which they
are now reprinted, with a few slight additions, by permission of
the Editor.&nbsp; In bringing out a second edition, I have
incorporated the substance of other articles originally written
for local journals.&nbsp; It is to be hoped, touching as they do
a theme not easily exhausted, but always interesting to East
Anglians, that they may help to sustain that love of one&rsquo;s
county which, alas! like the love of country, is a matter
reckoned to be of little importance in these cosmopolitan days,
but which, nevertheless, has had not a little share in the
formation of that national greatness and glory in which at all
times Englishmen believe.</p>
<p><!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>One word more.&nbsp; I have retained some strictures on
the clergy of East Anglia, partly because they were true at the
time to which I refer, and partly because it gives me pleasure to
own that they are not so now.&nbsp; The Church of England
clergyman of to-day is an immense improvement on that of my
youth.&nbsp; In ability, in devotion to the duties of his
calling, in intelligence, in self-denial, in zeal, he is equal to
the clergy of any other denomination.&nbsp; If he has lost his
hold upon Hodge, that, at any rate, is not his fault.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Distinguished people born there&mdash;Its
Puritans and Nonconformists&mdash;The country round
Covehithe&mdash;Southwold&mdash;Suffolk dialect&mdash;The Great
Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>In his published Memoirs, the great Metternich observes that
if he had never been born he never could have loved or
hated.&nbsp; Following so illustrious a precedent, I may observe
that if I had not been born in East Anglia I never could have
been an East Anglian.&nbsp; Whether I should have been wiser or
better off had I been born elsewhere, is an interesting question,
which, however, it is to be hoped the public will forgive me if I
decline to discuss on the present occasion.</p>
<p>In a paper bearing the date of 1667, a Samuel Baker, of
Wattisfield Hall, writes: &lsquo;I was born at <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>a village
called Wrentham, which place I cannot pass by the mention of
without saying thus much, that religion has there flourished
longer, and that in much piety; the Gospel and grace of it have
been more powerfully and clearly preached, and more generally
received; the professors of it have been more sound in the matter
and open and steadfast in the profession of it in an hour of
temptation, have manifested a greater oneness amongst themselves
and have been more eminently preserved from enemies without
(albeit they dwell where Satan&rsquo;s seat is encompassed with
his malice and rage), than I think in any village of the like
capacity in England; which I speak as my duty to the place, but
to my particular shame rather than otherwise, that such a dry and
barren plant should spring out of such a soil.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
resemble this worthy Mr. Baker in two respects.&nbsp; In the
first place, I was born at Wrentham, though at a considerably
later period of time than 1667; and, secondly, if he was a barren
plant&mdash;he of whom we read, in Harmer&rsquo;s Miscellaneous
Works, that &lsquo;he was a gentleman of fortune and education,
very zealous for the Congregational plan of church government and
discipline, and a sufferer in its bonds for a good
conscience&rsquo;&mdash;what am I?</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Nor was it only piety that existed in this distant
parish.&nbsp; If the reader turns to the diary of John Evelyn,
under the date of 1679, he will find mention made of a child
brought up to London, &lsquo;son of one Mr. Wotton, formerly
amanuensis to Dr. Andrews, Bishop of Winton, who both read and
perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic and Syriac, and
most of the modern languages, disputed in divinity, law and all
the sciences, was skilful in history, both ecclesiastical and
profane; in a word, so universally and solidly learned at eleven
years of age that he was looked on as a miracle.&nbsp; Dr. Lloyd,
one of the most deep-learned divines of this nation in all sorts
of literature, with Dr. Burnet, who had severely examined him,
came away astonished, and told me they did not believe there had
the like appeared in the world.&nbsp; He had only been instructed
by his father, who being himself a learned person, confessed that
his son knew all that he himself knew.&nbsp; But what was more
admirable than his vast memory was his judgment and invention, he
being tried with divers hard questions which required maturity of
thought and experience.&nbsp; He was also dexterous in
chronology, antiquities, mathematics.&nbsp; In sum, an
<i>intellectus universalis</i> beyond all that we <!-- page
4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>reade of
Picus Mirandula, and other precoce witts, and yet withal a very
humble child.&rsquo;&nbsp; This prodigy was the son of the Rev.
Henry Wotton, minister of Wrentham, Suffolk.&nbsp; Sir William
Skippon, a parishioner, in a letter yet extant, describes the
wonderful achievements of the little fellow when but five years
old.&nbsp; He was admitted at Katherine Hall, Cambridge, some
months before he was ten years old.&nbsp; In after-years he was
the friend and defender of Bentley and the antagonist of Sir
William Temple in the great controversy about ancient and modern
learning.&nbsp; He died in 1726, and was buried at Buxted, in
Sussex.&nbsp; It is clear that there was no such intellectual
phenomenon in all London under the Stuarts as that little
Wrentham lad.</p>
<p>Of that village, when I came into the world, my father was the
honoured, laborious and successful minister.&nbsp; The
meeting-house, as it was called, which stood in the lane leading
from the church to the highroad, was a square red brick building,
vastly superior to any of the ancient meeting-houses round.&nbsp;
It stood in an enclosure, one side of which was devoted to the
reception of the farmers&rsquo; gigs, which, on a Sunday
afternoon, when the principal service was held, made quite a
respectable show when drawn up in a line.&nbsp; By <!-- page
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the side
of it was a cottage, in which lived the woman who kept the place
tidy, and her husband, who looked after the horses as they were
unharnessed and put in the stable close by.&nbsp; The backs of
the gigs were sheltered from the road by a hedge of lilacs, and
over the gateway a gigantic elm kept watch and ward.&nbsp; The
house in which we lived was also part of the chapel estate, and,
if it was a little way off, it was, at any rate, adapted to the
wants of a family of quiet habits and simple tastes.&nbsp; On one
side of the house was a water-butt, and I can well remember my
first sad experience of the wickedness of the world when, getting
up one morning to look after my rabbits and other live stock, I
found that water-butt had gone, and that there were thieves in a
village so rural and renowned for piety as ours.&nbsp; I say
renowned, and not without reason.&nbsp; Years and years back
there was a pious clergyman of the name of Steffe, who had a son
in Dr. Doddridge&rsquo;s Academy, at Daventry, and it is a fact
that the great Doctor himself, at some time or other, had been a
guest in the village.</p>
<p>In 1741 the Doctor thus records his East Anglian
recollections, in a letter to his wife: &lsquo;You have great
reason to confide in that very kind Providence which has hitherto
watched over <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>us, and has, since the date of my
last, brought us about sixty miles nearer London.&nbsp; From
Yarmouth we went on Friday morning to Wrentham, where good Mrs.
Steffe lives, and from thence to a gentleman&rsquo;s seat, near
Walpole, where I was most respectfully entertained.&nbsp; As I
had twenty miles to ride yesterday morning, he, though I had
never seen him before last Tuesday, brought me almost half-way in
his chaise, to make the journey easier.&nbsp; I reached
Woodbridge before two, and rode better in the cool of the
evening, and had the happiness to be entertained in a very
elegant and friendly family, though perfectly a stranger; and,
indeed, I have been escorted from one place to another in every
mile of my journey by one, and sometimes by two or three, of my
brethren in a most respectful and agreeable manner.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Dr. Doddridge&rsquo;s East Anglian recollections seem to have
been uncommonly agreeable, owing quite as much, I must candidly
confess, to the presence of the sisters as of the brethren.&nbsp;
Writing to his wife an account of a little trip on the river, he
adds: &lsquo;It was a very pleasant day, and I concluded it in
the company of one of the finest women I ever beheld, who, though
she had seven children grown up to marriageable years, or very
near it, is <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>still herself almost a beauty, and a
person of sense, good breeding, and piety, which might astonish
one who had not the happiness of being intimately acquainted with
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a sly rogue was Dr. Doddridge!&nbsp; How
could any wife be jealous when her husband finishes off with such
a compliment to herself?</p>
<p>But to return to the good Mrs. Steffe, of whom I am, on my
mother&rsquo;s side, a descendant.&nbsp; I must add that as there
were great men before Agamemnon, so there were good people in the
little village of Wrentham before Mrs. Steffe appeared upon the
scene.&nbsp; The Brewsters, who were an ancient family, which
seems to have culminated under the glorious usurpation of Oliver
Cromwell, were eminently good people in Dr. Doddridge&rsquo;s
acceptation of the term, and I fancy did much as lords of the
manor&mdash;and as inhabitants of Wrentham Hall, a building which
had ceased to exist long before my time&mdash;to leaven with
their goodness the surrounding lump.&nbsp; It seems to me that
these Brewsters must have been more or less connected with
Brewster the elder&mdash;of Robinson&rsquo;s Church at Leyden,
who, we are told, came of a wealthy and distinguished
family&mdash;who was well trained at Cambridge, and, says the
historian, &lsquo;thence, being first seasoned with <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the
seeds of grace and virtue, he went to the Court, and there served
that religious and godly Mr. Davison divers years, when he was
Secretary of State, who found him so discreet and faithful as he
trusted him, above all others that were about him, and only
employed him in matters of great trust and secrecy; he esteemed
him rather as a son than a servant, and for his wisdom and
godliness in private, he would converse with him more like a
familiar than a master.&rsquo;&nbsp; When evil times came, this
Brewster was living in the big Manor House at Scrooby, and how he
and his godly associates were driven into exile by a foolish King
and cruel priests is known, or ought to be known, to
everyone.&nbsp; Of these Wrentham Brewsters, one served his
country in Parliament, or I am very much mistaken.&nbsp; It was
to their credit that they sought out godly men, to whom they
might entrust the cure of souls.&nbsp; In this respect, when I
was a lad, their example certainly had not been followed, and
Dissent flourished mainly because the moral instincts of the
villagers and farmers and small tradesmen were shocked by hearing
men on the Sunday reading the Lessons of the Church, leading the
devotions of the people, and preaching sermons, who on the
week-days got drunk and led immoral <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>lives.&nbsp; As
to the right of the State to interfere in matters of religion, as
to the danger to religion itself from the establishment of a
State Church, as to the liberty of unlicensed prophesying, such
topics the simple villagers ignored.&nbsp; All that they felt was
that there came to them more of a quickening of the spiritual
life, a fuller realization of God and things divine, in the
meeting-house than in the parish church.&nbsp; They were not what
pious Churchmen so much dread nowadays&mdash;Political
Dissenters; how could they be such, having no votes, and never
seeing a newspaper from one year&rsquo;s end to the other?</p>
<p>It was to the Brewsters that the village was indebted for the
ministry of the Rev. John Phillip, who married the sister of the
pious and learned Dr. Ames, Professor of the University of
Franeker.&nbsp; Calamy tells us that by means of Dr. Ames, Mr.
Phillip had no small furtherance in his studies, and intimate
acquaintance with him increased his inclination to the
Congregational way.&nbsp; Archbishop Abbot, writing to Winwood,
1611, says: &lsquo;I have written to Sir Horace Vere touching the
English preacher at the Hague.&nbsp; We heard what he was that
preceded, and we cannot be less cognisant what Mr. Ames is, for
by a Latin printed book he hath laden the Church and State of
England with <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>a great deal of infamous contumely,
so that if he were amongst us he would be so far from receiving
preferment, that some exemplary punishment would be his
reward.&nbsp; His Majesty had been advertised how this man is
entertained and embraced at the Hague, and how he is a fit person
to breed up captains and soldiers there in mutiny and
faction.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of Dr. Ames&rsquo;s works, which got
him into trouble, was entitled &lsquo;A Fresh Suit against
Ceremonies,&rsquo; a work which we may be sure would be as
distasteful to the Ritualists of our day as it was to the
Ritualists of his own.&nbsp; One of his works, his &lsquo;Medulla
Theologi&aelig;,&rsquo; I believe, adorned the walls of the
paternal study.&nbsp; There is, belonging to the Wrentham
Congregational Church Library, a volume of tracts, sixty-seven in
number, of six or eight pages each, printed in 1622, forming a
series of theses on theological topics, maintained by different
persons, under the presidency of Dr. Ames; and I believe a son of
the Doctor is buried in Wrentham Churchyard, as I recollect my
father, on one occasion, had an old gravestone done up and
relettered, which bore testimony to the virtues and piety and
learning of an Ames.&nbsp; Thus if Mr. Phillip was chased out of
Old England into New England for his Nonconformity, some of the
good <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>old Noncons remained to uphold the lamp which was one
day to cast a sacred light on all quarters of the land.&nbsp;
That some did emigrate with their pastor is probable, since we
learn that there is a town called Wrentham across the Atlantic,
said to have received that name because some of the first
settlers came from Wrentham in England.</p>
<p>Touching Mr. Phillip, a good deal has been written by the Rev.
John Browne, the painstaking author of &lsquo;The History of
Congregationalism in Suffolk and Norfolk.&rsquo;&nbsp; It appears
that his arrival in America was not unexpected, as the Christian
people of Dedham had invited him to that plantation
beforehand.&nbsp; He did not, however, accept their invitation,
but being much in request, &lsquo;and called divers ways, could
not resolve; but, at length, upon weighty reasons concerning the
public service and foundations of the college, he was persuaded
to attend to the call of Cambridge;&rsquo; and, adds an American
writer, &lsquo;he might have been the first head of that blessed
institution.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the calling of the Long Parliament,
he and his wife returned to England, and in 1642 we find him
ministering to his old flock.&nbsp; So satisfied were the
neighbouring Independents of his Congregationalism, that when, in
1644, members of Mr. <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Bridge&rsquo;s church residing in
Norwich desired to form themselves into a separate community,
they not only consulted with their brethren in Yarmouth, but with
Mr. Phillip also, as the only man then in their neighbourhood on
whose judgment and experience they could rely.&nbsp; In 1643 Mr.
Phillip was appointed one of the members of the Assembly of
Divines, and was recognised by Baillie in his Letters as one of
the Independent men there.&nbsp; The Independents, as we know,
sat apart, and were a sad thorn in the Presbyterians&rsquo;
side.&nbsp; Five of them, more zealous than the rest, formally
dissented from the decisions of the Assembly, and afraid that
toleration would not be extended to them, appealed to Parliament,
&lsquo;as the most sacred refuge and asylum for mistaken and
misjudged innocence.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Phillip&rsquo;s name,
however, I do not find in that list; and possibly he was too old
to be very active in the matter.&nbsp; He lived on till 1660,
when he died at the good old age of seventy-eight.&nbsp; In the
later years of his ministry he was assisted by his nephew, W.
Ames, who in 1651 preached a sermon at St. Paul&rsquo;s, before
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, &lsquo;On the Saint&rsquo;s Security
against Seducing Sports, or the Anointing from the Holy
One.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is to be feared, in our <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>more
enlightened age, a good Wrentham Congregational minister would
have little chance of preaching before a London Lord Mayor.&nbsp;
Talent is supposed to exist only in the crowded town, where men
have no time to think of anything but of the art of getting
on.</p>
<p>Other heroic associations&mdash;of men who had suffered for
the faith, who feared God rather than man, who preferred the
peace of an approving conscience to the vain honours of the
world&mdash;also were connected with the place.&nbsp; I remember
being shown a bush in which the conventicle preacher used to hide
himself when the enemy, in the shape of the myrmidons of Bishop
Wren, of Norwich, were at his heels.&nbsp; That furious prelate,
as many of us know, drove upwards of three thousand persons to
seek their bread in a foreign land.&nbsp; Indeed, to such an
extent did he carry out his persecuting system, that the trade
and manufactures of the country materially suffered in
consequence.&nbsp; However, in my boyish days I was not troubled
much about such things.&nbsp; Dissent in Wrentham was quite
respectable.&nbsp; If we had lost the Brewster family, whose arms
were still to be seen on the Communion plate, a neighbouring
squire attended at the meeting-house, as it was <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>then the
fashion to call our chapel, and so did the leading grocer and
draper of the place, and the village doctor, the father of six
comely daughters; and the display of gigs on a Sunday was really
imposing.&nbsp; Alas! as I grew older I saw that imposing array
not a little shorn of its splendour.&nbsp; The neighbouring
baronet, Sir Thomas Gooch, M.P., added as he could farm to farm,
and that a Dissenter was on no account to have one of his farms
was pretty well understood.&nbsp; I fancy our great landlords
have, in many parts of East Anglia, pretty well exterminated
Dissent, to the real injury of the people all around.&nbsp; I
write this advisedly.&nbsp; I dare say the preaching in the
meeting-house was often very miserably poor.&nbsp; The service, I
must own, seemed to me often peculiarly long and
unattractive.&nbsp; There was always that long prayer which was,
I fear, to all boys a time of utter weariness; but, nevertheless,
there was a moral and intellectual life in our Dissenting circle
that did not exist elsewhere.&nbsp; It was true we never attended
dinners at the village public-house, nor indulged in
card-parties, and regarded with a horror, which I have come to
think unwholesome, the frivolity of balls or the attractions of a
theatre; but we had all the new books voted into our bookclub,
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>and, as a lad, I can well remember how I revelled in the
back numbers of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, though even then I
could not but feel the injustice which it did to what it called
the Lake school of poets, and more especially to Coleridge and
Wordsworth.&nbsp; Shakespeare also was almost a sealed book, and
perhaps we had a little too much of religious reading, such as
Doddridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rise and Progress,&rsquo; or
Baxter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Saint&rsquo;s Rest,&rsquo; or
Alleine&rsquo;s &lsquo;Call to the Unconverted,&rsquo; or
Fleetwood&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Christ&rsquo;&mdash;excellent
books in their way, undoubtedly, but not remarkably attractive to
boys redolent of animal life, who had thriven and grown fat in
that rustic village, on whose vivid senses the world that now is
produced far more effect than the terrors or splendours of the
world to come.</p>
<p>The country round, if flat, was full of interesting
associations.&nbsp; At the back of us&mdash;that is, on the
sea&mdash;was the village of Covehithe, and when a visitor found
his way into the place&mdash;an event which happened now and
then&mdash;our first excursion with him or her&mdash;for plenty
of donkeys were to be had which ladies could ride&mdash;was to
Covehithe, known to literary men as the birthplace of John Bale,
Bishop of Ossory, in Ireland.&nbsp; In connection with donkeys, I
have this interesting recollection, <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>that one of
the old men of the village told me.&nbsp; At the time of the
Bristol riots, he remembered Sir Charles Wetherall, the occasion
of them, as a boy at Wrentham much given to donkey-riding.&nbsp;
In the history of the drama John Bale takes distinguished
rank.&nbsp; He was one of those by whom the drama was gradually
evolved, and all to whom it is a study and delight must remember
him with regard.&nbsp; His play of &lsquo;Kynge John&rsquo; is
described by Mr. Collier as occupying an intermediate place
between moralities and historical plays&mdash;and it is the only
known existing specimen of that species of composition of so
early a date.&nbsp; Bale, who was trained at the monastery of
White Friars, in Norwich, thence went to Jesus College,
Cambridge, and was expelled in consequence of the zeal with which
he exposed the errors of Popery.&nbsp; However, Bale had a friend
and protector in Cromwell, Henry VIII.&rsquo;s faithful
servant.&nbsp; On the death of that nobleman Bale proceeded to
Germany, where he appears to have been well received and
hospitably entertained by Luther and Melancthon, and on the
accession of Edward VI. he returned to England.&nbsp; In
Mary&rsquo;s reign persecution recommenced, and Bale fled to
Frankfort.&nbsp; He again returned at the commencement of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>was made
prebend of Canterbury, at which place he died at the age of
sixty-three.&nbsp; Covehithe nowadays is not interesting so much
as the birthplace of Bale, as on account of its ecclesiastical
ruins, which are covered with ivy and venerable in their
decay.&nbsp; The church was evidently almost a cathedral, and
surely at one time or other there must have been an enormous
population to worship in such a sanctuary; and yet all you see
now is a public-house just opposite the church, a few cottages,
and a farmhouse.&nbsp; A few steps farther bring you to the low
cliff, and there is the sea ever encroaching on the land in that
quarter and swallowing up farmhouse and farm.&nbsp; Miss Agnes
Strickland, who lived at Reydon Hall&mdash;a few miles
inland&mdash;has thus sung the melancholy fate of Covehithe:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;All roofless now the stately pile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rent the arches tall,<br />
Through which with bright departing smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The western sunbeams fall.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tradition&rsquo;s voice forgets to tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose ashes sleep below,<br />
And Fancy here unchecked may dwell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bid the story flow.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah! what was that story?&nbsp; How the question puzzled my
young head, as I walked in the sandy <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>lane that led
from my native village!&nbsp; How insignificant looked the little
church built up inside!&nbsp; What had become of the crowds that
at one time must have filled that ancient fane?&nbsp; How was it
that no trace of them remained?&nbsp; They had vanished in the
historical age, and yet no one could tell how or when.&nbsp;
Nature was, then, stronger than man.&nbsp; He was gone, but the
stars glittered by night and the sun shone by day, and the ivy
had spread its green mantle over all.&nbsp; Yes! what was man,
with his pomp and glory, but dust and ashes, after all!&nbsp; How
I loved to go to Covehithe and climb its ruins, and dream of the
distant past!</p>
<p>Here in that eastern point of England it seemed to me there
was a good deal of decay.&nbsp; Sometimes, on a fine summer day,
we would take a boat and sail from the pretty little town of
Southwold, about four miles from Wrentham, to Dunwich, another
relic of the past.&nbsp; According to an old historian, it was a
city surrounded with a stone wall having brazen gates; it had
fifty-two churches, chapels, and religious houses; it also
boasted hospitals, a huge palace, a bishop&rsquo;s seat, a
mayor&rsquo;s mansion, and a Mint.&nbsp; Beyond it a forest
appears to have extended some miles into what is now the
sea.&nbsp; <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>One of our local Suffolk poets, James
Bird (I saw him but once, when I walked into his house, about
twelve miles from Wrentham, having run away from home at the ripe
age of ten, and told him I had come to see him, as he was a poet;
and I well remember how then, much to my chagrin, he gave me
plum-pudding for dinner, and sent me to play with his boys till a
cart was found in which the prodigal was compelled to return),
wrote and published a poetical romance, called &lsquo;Dunwich;
or, a Tale of the Splendid City;&rsquo; and Agnes Strickland also
made it the subject of her melodious verse, commencing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Oft gazing on thy craggy brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We muse on glories o&rsquo;er.<br />
Fair Dunwich!&nbsp; Thou art lonely now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Renowned and sought no more.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never has a splendid city more utterly collapsed.&nbsp; After
a long ride over sandy lanes and fields, you come to the edge of
a cliff, on which stand a few houses.&nbsp; There is all that
remains of the Dunwich where the first Bishop of East Anglia
taught the Christian faith, and where was born John Daye, the
printer of the works of Parker, Latimer, and Fox, who, in the
reign of Mary, became, as most real men did then, a prisoner and
an exile for the <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>truth.&nbsp; He has also the
reputation of being the first in England who printed in the Saxon
character.&nbsp; In the records of type-founding the name of Daye
stands with that of the most illustrious.&nbsp; When the Company
of Stationers obtained their charter from Philip and Mary, he was
the first person admitted to their livery.&nbsp; In 1580 he was
master of the company, to which he bequeathed property at his
death.&nbsp; The following is the inscription which marks the
place of his burial in Little Bradley, Suffolk:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Here lyes the <span
class="smcap">Daye</span> that darkness could not blynd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Popish fogges had overcast the sunne;<br />
This <span class="smcap">Daye</span> the cruel night did leave
behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To view and show what bloudie actes were donne.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He set a <span class="smcap">Fox</span> to write how
martyrs runne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By death to lyfe, <span class="smcap">Fox</span>
ventured paynes and health.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To give them light Daye spent in print his
wealth,<br />
But <span class="smcap">God</span> with gayne returned his wealth
agayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave to him as he gave to the poore.<br />
Two wyfes he had partakers of his payne:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each wyfe twelve babes, and each of them one
more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Als was the last increaser of his store;<br />
Who, mourning long for being left alone,<br />
Sett up this tombe, herself turned to a stone.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Covehithe, Dunwich has a history.&nbsp; In the reign of
Henry II., a MS. in the British Museum tells us, the Earl of
Leicester came to attack it.&nbsp; &lsquo;When he came neare and
beheld the <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>strength thereof, it was terror and
feare unto him to behold it; and so retired both he and his
people.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dunwich aided King John in his wars with the
barons, and thus gained the first charter.&nbsp; In the time of
Edward I. it had sixteen fair ships, twelve barks,
four-and-twenty fishing barks, and at that time there were few
seaports in England that could say as much.&nbsp; It served the
same King in his wars with France with eleven ships of war, well
furnished with men and munition.&nbsp; In most of these ships
were seventy-two men-at-arms, who served thirteen weeks at their
own cost and charge.&nbsp; Dunwich seems to have suffered much by
the French wars.&nbsp; Four of the eleven ships already referred
to were captured by the French, and in the wars waged by Edward
III. Dunwich lost still more shipping, and as many as 500
men.&nbsp; Perhaps it might have flourished till this day had if
not been for the curse of war.&nbsp; But the sea also served the
town cruelly.&nbsp; That spared nothing&mdash;not the
King&rsquo;s Forest, where there were hawking and
hunting&mdash;not the homes where England nursed her hardy
sailors&mdash;not even the harbour whence the brave East Anglians
sailed away to the wars.&nbsp; In Edward III.&rsquo;s time, at
one fell swoop, the remorseless sea seems to have swallowed up
&lsquo;400 houses <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>which payde rente to the towne
towards the fee-farms, besydes certain shops and
windmills.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet, when I was a lad, this wreck of a
place returned two members to Parliament, and Birmingham,
Manchester and Sheffield not one.&nbsp; Between Covehithe and
Dunwich stood, and still stands, the charming little
bathing-place of Southwold.&nbsp; Like them, it has seen better
days, and has suffered from the encroachments of the
ever-restless and ever-hungry sea.&nbsp; It was at Southwold that
I first saw the sea, and I remember naturally asking my father,
who showed me the guns on the gun-hill&mdash;pointing
seaward&mdash;whether that was where the enemies came from.</p>
<p>Southwold appears to have initiated an evangelical alliance,
which may yet be witnessed if ever a time comes of reasonable
toleration on religious matters.&nbsp; In many parts of the
Continent the same place of worship is used by different
religious bodies.&nbsp; In Brussels I have seen the
Episcopalians, the Germans, the French Protestants, all
assembling at different times in the same building.&nbsp; There
was a time when a similar custom prevailed in Southwold, and that
was when Master Sharpen, who had his abode at Sotterley, preached
at Southwold once a month.&nbsp; There were Independents in the
towns in <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>those days, and &lsquo;his
indulgence,&rsquo; writes a local historian, &lsquo;favoured the
Separatists with the liberty and free use of the church, where
they resorted weekly, or oftener, and every fourth Sunday both
ministers met and celebrated divine service alternately.&nbsp; He
that entered the church first had the precedency of officiating,
the other keeping silence until the congregation received the
Benediction after sermon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Most of the people
attended all the while.&nbsp; It was before the year 1680 that
these things were done.&nbsp; After that time there came to the
church &lsquo;an orthodox man, who suffered many ills, and those
not the lightest, for his King and for his faith, and he
compelled the Independents not only to leave the church, but the
town also.&nbsp; We read they assembled in a malt-house beyond
the bridge, where, being disturbed, they chose more private
places in the town until liberty of conscience was granted, when
they publicly assembled in a fish-house converted to a place of
worship.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that time many people in the town were
Dissenters; but it was not till 1748 that they had a church
formed.&nbsp; Up to that time the Southwold Independents were
members of the Church at Wrentham, one of the Articles of
Association of the new church being to take the Bible as their
sole <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>guide, and when in difficulties to resort to the
neighbouring pastor for advice and declaration.&nbsp; Such was
Independency when it flourished all over East Anglia.</p>
<p>A writer in the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i> says that
&lsquo;Southwold, of sea-coast town, is the most beneficial unto
his Majesty of all the towns in England, by reason all their
trade is unto Iceland for lings.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the little
harbour of Southwold you see nowadays only a few colliers, and I
fear that the place is of little advantage to her Majesty,
however beneficial it may be as a health-resort for some of her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; It is a place, gentle reader,
where you can wander undisturbed at your own sweet will, and can
get your cheeks fanned by breezes unknown in London.&nbsp; The
beach, I own, is shingly, and not to be compared with the sands
of Yarmouth and Lowestoft; but, then, you are away from the
Cockney crowds that now infest these places at the bathing
season, and you are quiet&mdash;whether you wander on its common,
till you come to the Wolsey Bridge, getting on towards
Halesworth, where, if tradition be trustworthy, Wolsey, as a
butcher&rsquo;s boy, was nearly drowned, and where he
benevolently caused a bridge to be erected for the safety of all
future butcher-boys and others, <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>when he
became a distinguished man; or ramble by the seaside to
Walberswick, across the harbour, or on to Easton
Bavent&mdash;another decayed village, on the other side.&nbsp;
Southwold has its historical associations.&nbsp; Most of my
readers have seen the well-known picture of Solebay Fight at
Greenwich Hospital.&nbsp; Southwold overlooks the bay on which
that fight was won.&nbsp; Here, on the morning of the 28th May,
1672, De Ruyter, with his Dutchmen, sailed right against those
wooden walls which have guarded old England in many a time of
danger, and found to his cost how invincible was British
pluck.&nbsp; James, Duke of York&mdash;not then the drivelling
idiot who lost his kingdom for a Mass, but James, manly and
high-spirited, with a Prince&rsquo;s pride and a sailor&rsquo;s
heart&mdash;won a victory that for many a day was a favourite
theme with all honest Englishmen, and especially with the true
and stout men who, alarmed by the roar of cannon, as the sound
boomed along the blue waters of that peaceful bay, stood on the
Southwold cliff, wishing that the fog which intercepted their
view might clear off, and that they might welcome as victors
their brethren on the sea.&nbsp; I can remember how, when an old
cannon was dragged up from the depths of the sea, it was supposed
to be, as <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>it might have been, used in that
fight, and now is preserved at one of the look-out houses on the
cliff as a souvenir of that glorious struggle.&nbsp; The details
of that fight are matters of history, and I need not dwell on
them.&nbsp; Our literature, also, owes Southwold one of the
happiest effusions of one of the wittiest writers of that age;
and in a county history I remember well a merry song on the
Duke&rsquo;s late glorious success over the Dutch, in Southwold
Bay, which commences with the writer telling&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One day as I was sitting still<br />
Upon the side of Dunwich Hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And looking on the ocean,<br />
By chance I saw De Ruyter&rsquo;s fleet<br />
With Royal James&rsquo;s squadron meet;<br />
In sooth it was a noble treat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see that brave commotion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer vividly paints the scene, and ends as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to King Charles, and
here&rsquo;s to James,<br />
And here&rsquo;s to all the captains&rsquo; names,<br />
And here&rsquo;s to all the Suffolk dames,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s to the house of Stuart.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, as to the house of Stuart, the less said the better; but
as to the Suffolk dames, I agree with the poet, that they are all
well worthy of the toast, and it was at a very early period of my
existence <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>that I became aware of that
fact.&nbsp; But the course of true love never does run smooth,
and from none&mdash;and they were many&mdash;with whom I played
on the beach as a boy, or read poetry to at riper years, was it
my fate to take one as wife for better or worse.&nbsp; In the
crowded city men have little time to fall in love.&nbsp; Besides,
they see so many fresh faces that impressions are easily
erased.&nbsp; It is otherwise in the quiet retirement of a
village where there is little to disturb the mind&mdash;perhaps
too little.&nbsp; I can well remember a striking illustration of
this in the person of an old farmer, who lived about three miles
off, and at whose house we&mdash;that is, the whole
family&mdash;passed what seemed to me a very happy day among the
haystacks or harvest-fields once or twice a year.&nbsp; The old
man was proud of his farm, and of everything connected with
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;There, Master James,&rsquo; he was wont to say
to me after dinner, &lsquo;you can see three barns all at
once!&rsquo; and sure enough, looking in the direction he
pointed, there were three barns plainly visible to the naked
eye.&nbsp; Alas! the love of the picturesque had not been
developed in my bucolic friend, and a good barn or two&mdash;he
was an old bachelor, and, I suppose, his heart had never been
softened by the love of woman&mdash;seemed to him <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>about
as beautiful an object as you could expect or desire.&nbsp; One
emotion, that of fear, was, however, I found, strongly planted in
the village breast.&nbsp; The boys of the village, with whom, now
and then, I stole away on a birds&rsquo;-nesting expedition,
would have it that in a little wood about a mile or two off there
were no end of flying serpents and dragons to be seen; and I can
well remember the awe which fell upon the place when there came a
rumour of the doings of those wretches, Burke and Hare, who were
said to have made a living by murdering victims&mdash;by placing
pitch plasters on their mouths&mdash;and selling them to the
doctors to dissect.&nbsp; At this time a little boy had not come
home at the proper time, and the mother came to our house
lamenting.&nbsp; The good woman was in tears, and refused to be
comforted.&nbsp; There had been a stranger in the village that
day; he had seen her boy, he had put a pitch plaster on his
mouth, and no doubt his dead body was then on its way to Norwich
to be sold to the doctor.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it turned out that
the boy was alive and well, and lived to give his poor mother a
good deal of trouble.&nbsp; Another thing, of which I have still
a vivid recollection, was the mischief wrought by Captain
Swing.&nbsp; In Kent there had been an <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>alarming
outbreak of the peasantry, ostensibly against the use of
agricultural machinery.&nbsp; They assembled in large bodies, and
visited the farm buildings of the principal landed proprietors,
demolishing the threshing machines then being brought into
use.&nbsp; In some instances they set fire to barns and
corn-stacks.&nbsp; These outrages spread throughout the county,
and fears were entertained that they would be repeated in other
agricultural districts.&nbsp; A great meeting of magistrates and
landed gentry was held in Canterbury, the High Sheriff in the
chair, when a reward was offered of &pound;100 for the discovery
of the perpetrators of the senseless mischief, and the Lords of
the Treasury offered a further reward of the same amount for
their apprehension; but all was in vain to stop the growing
evil.&nbsp; The agricultural interest was in a very depressed
state, and the number of unemployed labourers so large, that
apprehensions were entertained that the combinations for the
destruction of machinery might, if not at once checked, take
dimensions it would be very difficult for the Government to
control.&nbsp; When Parliament opened in 1830, the state of the
agricultural districts had been daily growing more
alarming.&nbsp; Rioting and incendiarism had spread from Kent to
Suffolk, <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Norfolk, Surrey, Hampshire,
Wiltshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Huntingdonshire, and
Cambridgeshire, and a great deal of very valuable property had
been destroyed.&nbsp; A mystery enveloped these proceedings that
indicated organization, and it became suspected that they had a
political object.&nbsp; Threatening letters were sent to
individuals signed &lsquo;Swing,&rsquo; and beacon fires
communicated from one part of the country to the other.&nbsp;
With the object of checking these outrages, night patrols were
established, dragoons were kept in readiness to put down
tumultuous meetings, and magistrates and clergymen and landed
gentry were all at their wits&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; Even in our
out-of-the-way corner of East Anglia not a little consternation
was felt.&nbsp; We were on the highroad nightly traversed by the
London and Yarmouth Royal Mail, and thus, more or less, we had
communications with the outer world.&nbsp; Just outside of our
village was Benacre Hall, the seat of Sir Thomas Gooch, one of
the county members, and I well remember the boyish awe with which
I heard that a mob had set out from Yarmouth to burn the place
down.&nbsp; Whether the mob thought better of it, or gave up the
walk of eighteen miles as one to which they were not equal, I am
not in a position to say.&nbsp; All <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>I know is,
that Benacre Hall, such as it is, remains; but I can never forget
the feeling of terror with which, on those dark and dull winter
nights, I looked out of my bedroom window to watch the lurid
light flaring up into the black clouds around, which told how
wicked men were at their mad work, how fiendish passion had
triumphed, how some honest farmer was reduced to ruin, as he saw
the efforts of a life of industry consumed by the
incendiary&rsquo;s fire.&nbsp; It was long before I ceased to
shudder at the name of &lsquo;Swing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dialect of the village was, I need not add, East
Anglian.&nbsp; The people said &lsquo;I woll&rsquo; for &lsquo;I
will&rsquo;; &lsquo;you warn&rsquo;t&rsquo; for &lsquo;you were
not,&rsquo; and so on.&nbsp; A girl was called a
&lsquo;mawther,&rsquo; a pitcher a &lsquo;gotch,&rsquo; a
&lsquo;clap on the costard&rsquo; was a knock on the head, a lad
was a &lsquo;bor.&rsquo;&nbsp; Names of places especially were
made free with.&nbsp; Wangford was &lsquo;Wangfor,&rsquo;
Covehithe was &lsquo;Cothhigh,&rsquo; Southwold was
&lsquo;Soul,&rsquo; Lowestoft was &lsquo;Lesteff,&rsquo;
Halesworth was &lsquo;Holser,&rsquo; London was
&lsquo;Lunun.&rsquo;&nbsp; People who lived in the midland
counties were spoken of as living in the shires.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;o,&rsquo; as in &lsquo;bowls,&rsquo; it is specially
difficult for an East Anglian to pronounce.&nbsp; A learned man
was held to be a &lsquo;man of larnin&rsquo;,&rsquo; a thing of
which there was not too much in Suffolk in my <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>young
days.&nbsp; A lady in the village sent her son to school, and
great was the maternal pride as she called in my father to hear
how well her son could read Latin, the reading being reading
alone, without the faintest attempt at translation.&nbsp;
Sometimes it was hard to get an answer to a question, as when a
Dissenting minister I knew was sent for to visit a sick
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;My good man,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what
induced you to send for me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hey, what?&rsquo;
said the invalid.&nbsp; &lsquo;What induced you to send for
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas! the question was repeated in vain.&nbsp;
At length the wife interfered: &lsquo;He wants to know what the
deuce you sent for him for.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, and not till
then, came an appropriate reply.&nbsp; This story, I believe, has
more than once found its way into <i>Punch</i>; but I heard it as
a Suffolk boy years and years before <i>Punch</i> had come into
existence.</p>
<p>One of the prayers familiar to my youth was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br />
Bless the bed that I lie on;<br />
Four corners to my bed,<br />
Four angels at my head;<br />
Two to watch and one to pray,<br />
And one to carry my soul away.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An M.P., who shall be nameless, supplies me with an apt
illustration of East Anglian dialect.&nbsp; It <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>was at the
anniversary of a National School, with the great M.P. in the
chair, surrounded by the benevolent ladies and the select clergy
of the district.&nbsp; The subject of examination was
Christ&rsquo;s entry into Jerusalem on an ass&rsquo;s colt.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the M.P.&mdash;&lsquo;why did they strew
rushes before the Saviour? can any of you children tell
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Profound silence.&nbsp; The M.P. repeated the
question.&nbsp; A little ragamuffin held up his hand.&nbsp; The
M.P. demanded silence as the apt scholar proceeded with his
answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why were the rushes strewed?&rsquo; said the
M.P. in a condescending tone.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo;
replied the boy, &lsquo;unless it was to hull the dickey
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roars of laughter greeted the reply, as all the East Anglians
present knew that &lsquo;hull&rsquo; meant &lsquo;throw,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;dickey&rsquo; is Suffolk for &lsquo;donkey,&rsquo; but
some of the Cockney visitors present were for a while quite
unable to enjoy the joke.</p>
<p>It is to be feared the three R&rsquo;s were not much
patronized in East Anglia, if it be true that some forty or fifty
years ago, in such a respectable town as Sudbury, it was the
fashion for some fifty of the leading inhabitants to meet in the
large bar-parlour of the old White Horse to hear the leading
paper of the eastern counties read out by a scholar and <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>elocutionist known as John.&nbsp; For the discharge of
this important duty he was paid a pound a year, and provided with
as much free liquor as he liked, and there were people who
considered that the Saturday newspaper-reading did them more good
than what they heard at church the next day.</p>
<p>In some cases our East Anglian dialect is merely a survival of
old English, as when we say &lsquo;axe&rsquo; for
&lsquo;ask.&rsquo;&nbsp; We find in Chaucer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is but foly and wrong wenging<br />
To axe so outrageous thing.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his &lsquo;Envious Man,&rsquo; Gowing made
&lsquo;axeth&rsquo; to rhyme with &lsquo;taxeth.&rsquo;&nbsp; No
word is more common in Suffolk than &lsquo;fare&rsquo;; a pony is
a &lsquo;hobby&rsquo;; a thrush is a &lsquo;mavis&rsquo;; a chest
is a &lsquo;kist&rsquo;; a shovel is a &lsquo;skuppet&rsquo;; a
chaffinch is a &lsquo;spink.&rsquo;&nbsp; If a man is upset in
his mind, he tells us he is &lsquo;wholly stammed,&rsquo; and the
Suffolk &lsquo;yow&rsquo; is at least as old as Chaucer, who
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What do you ye do there, quod she,<br />
Come, and if it lyke yow<br />
To daucen daunceth with us now.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An awkward lad is &lsquo;ungain.&rsquo;&nbsp; A good deal may
be written to show that our Suffolk dialect is the nearest of all
provincial dialects to that of Chaucer and the Bible, and if
anyone has the audacity to <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>contradict
me, why, then, in Suffolk phraseology, I can promise
him&mdash;&lsquo;a good hiding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am old enough to remember how placid was the county, how
stay-at-home were the people, what a sensation there was created
when anyone went to London, or any stranger appeared in our
midst.&nbsp; From afar we heard of railways; then we had a
railway opened from London to Brentwood; then the railways spread
all over the land, and there were farmers who did think that they
had something to do with the potato disease.&nbsp; The change was
not a pleasant one: the turnpikes were deserted; the inns were
void of customers; no longer did the villagers hasten to see the
coach change horses, and the bugle of the guard was heard no
more.&nbsp; For a time the Eastern Counties Railway had a
somewhat dolorous career.&nbsp; It was thought to be something to
be thankful for when the traveller by it reached his
journey&rsquo;s end in decent time and without an accident.&nbsp;
Now the change is marvellous.&nbsp; The Great Eastern Railway
stands in the foremost rank of the lines terminating in
London.&nbsp; It now runs roundly 20,000,000 of train miles in
the course of a year.&nbsp; It carries a larger number of
passengers than any other line.&nbsp; It carries the London
working man <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>twelve miles in and twelve miles out
for twopence a day.&nbsp; It is the direct means of communication
with all the North of Europe by its fine steamers from
Harwich.&nbsp; It has yearly an increased number of
season-ticket-holders.&nbsp; On a Whit Monday it gives 125,000
excursionists a happy day in the country or by the seaside.&nbsp;
In 1891 the number of passengers carried was 81,268,661,
exclusive of season-ticket-holders.&nbsp; It is conspicuous now
for its punctuality and freedom from accidents.&nbsp; It is, in
short, a model of good management, and it also deserves credit
for looking well after the interests of its employ&eacute;s, of
whom there are some 25,000.&nbsp; It contributes to the Accident
Fund, to the Provident Society, to the Superannuation Fund, and
to the Pension Fund, to which the men also subscribe, in the most
liberal manner, and besides has established a savings bank, which
returns the men who place their money in it four per cent.&nbsp;
It is a liberal master.&nbsp; It does its duty to its men, who
deserve well of the public as of the Great Eastern Railway
itself; but its main merit, after all, is that it has been the
making of East Anglia.</p>

<span class="smcap">the stricklands</span>.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Reydon Hall&mdash;The
clergy&mdash;Pakefield&mdash;Social life in a village.</p>
<p>As I write I have lying before me a little book called
&lsquo;Hugh Latimer; or, The School-boy&rsquo;s
Friendship,&rsquo; by Miss Strickland, author of the
&lsquo;Little Prisoner,&rsquo; &lsquo;Charles Grant,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Prejudice and Principle,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Little
Quaker.&rsquo;&nbsp; It bears the imprint&mdash;&lsquo;London:
Printed for A. R. Newman and Co., Leadenhall Street.&rsquo;&nbsp;
On a blank page inside I find the following: &lsquo;James Ewing
Ritchie, with his friend Susanna&rsquo;s affectionate
regards.&rsquo;&nbsp; Susanna was a sister of Miss Agnes
Strickland, the authoress, and was as much a writer as
herself.&nbsp; The Stricklands were a remarkable family, living
about four or five miles from Wrentham, on the road leading from
Wangford to Southwold, at an old-fashioned residence called
Reydon Hall.&nbsp; They had, I fancy, seen better days, and were
none the worse for that.&nbsp; The Stricklands came over <!--
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>with William the Conqueror.&nbsp; One of them was the
first to land, and hence the name.&nbsp; A good deal of blue
blood flowed in their veins.&nbsp; Kate&mdash;to my eyes the
fairest of the lot&mdash;was named Katherine Parr, to denote that
she was a descendant of one of the wives of the too-much-married
Henry VIII., and in the old-fashioned drawing-room of Reydon Hall
I heard not a little&mdash;they all talked at once&mdash;of what
to me was strange and rare.&nbsp; Mr. Strickland had deceased
some years, and the widow and the daughters kept up what little
state they could; and I well remember the feeling of surprise
with which I first entered their capacious drawing-room&mdash;a
room the size of which it had never entered into my head to
conceive of.&nbsp; It is to the credit of these Misses Strickland
that they did not vegetate in that old house, but held a fair
position in the world of letters.&nbsp; Miss Strickland herself
chiefly resided in town.&nbsp; Agnes, the next, whose
&lsquo;Queens of England&rsquo; is still a standard book, was
more frequently at home.&nbsp; The only one of the family who did
not write was Sarah, who married one of the Radical Childses of
Bungay, and who not till after the death of her husband became
respectable and atoned for her sins by marrying a
clergyman.&nbsp; <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Kate, as I have said, the fairest of
the whole, married an officer in the army of the name of Traill,
and went out to Canada, and wrote there a book called &lsquo;The
Backwoods of Canada,&rsquo; which was certainly one of the most
popular of the four-and-sixpenny volumes published under the
auspices of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful and
Entertaining Knowledge.&nbsp; Our friend was Susanna, who wrote a
volume of poems on Enthusiasm, and who seemed to me, with her
dark eyes and hair, a very enthusiastic personage indeed.&nbsp;
The reason of her friendship with our family was her deeply
religious nature, which impelled her to leave the cold and
careless service of the Church&mdash;not a little to the disgust
of her aristocratic sisters, who, as of ancient lineage, not a
little haughty, and rank Tories, had but little sympathy with
Dissent..&nbsp; Susanna was much at our house, and when away
scarcely a day passed on which she did not write some of us a
letter or send us a book.&nbsp; Then there was a brother Tom, a
midshipman&mdash;a wonderful being to my inexperienced
eyes&mdash;who once or twice came to our house seated in the
family donkey-chaise, which seemed to me, somehow or other, not
to be an ordinary donkey-chaise, but something of a far superior
character.&nbsp; I have <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>pleasant recollections of them all,
and of the annuals in which they all wrote, and a good many of
which fell to my share.&nbsp; Like her sister, Susanna married an
officer in the army&mdash;a Major Moodie&mdash;and emigrated to
Canada, where the Stricklands have now a high position, where she
had sons and daughters born to her, and wrote more than one novel
which found acceptance in the English market.&nbsp; The
Stricklands gave me quite a literary turn.&nbsp; When I was a
small boy it was really an everyday occurrence for me to write a
book or edit a newspaper, and with about as much success as is
generally achieved by bookmakers and newspaper editors, whose
merit is overlooked by an unthinking public.&nbsp; Let me say in
the Stricklands I found an indulgent audience.&nbsp; On one
occasion I remember reciting some verses of my own composition,
commencing,</p>
<p class="gutsumm">&lsquo;I sing a song of ancient men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of warriors great and bold,<br />
Of Hercules, a famous man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lived in times of old.<br />
He was a man of great renown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lion large he slew,<br />
And to his memory games were kept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which now I tell to you,&rsquo;</p>
<p>which they got me to repeat in their drawing-room, <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and
which, though I say it that should not, evinced for a boy a fair
acquaintance with &lsquo;Mangnall&rsquo;s Questions&rsquo; and
Pinnock&rsquo;s abridgment of Goldsmith&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of
Rome.&rsquo;&nbsp; Happily, at that time, Niebuhr was unknown,
and sceptical criticism had not begun its deadly work.&nbsp; We
had not to go far for truth then.&nbsp; It was quite unnecessary
to seek it&mdash;at any rate, so it seemed to us&mdash;at the
bottom of a well; there it was right underneath one&rsquo;s
nose&mdash;before one&rsquo;s very eyes in the printed pages of
the printed book.</p>
<p>Agnes Strickland did all she could to confer reputation on her
native county.&nbsp; The tall, dark, self-possessed lady from
Reydon Hall was a lion everywhere.&nbsp; On one occasion she
visited the House of Lords, just after she had written a violent
letter against Lord Campbell, charging him with plagiarism.&nbsp;
Campbell tells us he had a conversation with her, which speedily
turned her into a friend.&nbsp; He adds: &lsquo;I thought
Brougham would have died with envy when I told him the result of
my interview, and Ellenborough, who was sitting by, lifted his
hands in admiration.&nbsp; Brougham had thrown me a note across
the table, saying: &ldquo;So you know your friend Miss Strickland
has come to hear you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Strickland often
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>visited Alison, the historian, at Possil House.&nbsp; He
says of her that she had strong talents of a masculine rather
than feminine character&mdash;indefatigable perseverance, and
that ardour in whatever pursuit she engaged in without which no
one could undergo similar fatigue.&nbsp; On one occasion she was
descanting on the noble feeling of Queen Mary, &lsquo;That may
all be very true, Miss Strickland,&rsquo; replied the historian;
&lsquo;but unfortunately she had an awkward habit of burning
people&mdash;she brought 239 men, women, and children to the
stake in a reign which did not extend beyond a few
years!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; was her reply,
&lsquo;it was terrible, dreadful, but it was the fault of the
age&mdash;the temper of the times; Mary herself was everything
that is noble and heroic.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such was her feminine
tendency to hero-worship.&nbsp; Another tendency of a feminine
character was her love of talking.&nbsp; &lsquo;She did,&rsquo;
instances Sir Archibald, &lsquo;not even require an answer or a
sign of mutual intelligence; it was enough if the one she was
addressing simply remained passive.&nbsp; One day when I was laid
up at Possil on my library sofa from a wound in the knee, she was
kind enough to sit with me for two hours, and was really very
entertaining, from the number of anecdotes she remembered of
queens in <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the olden time.&nbsp; When she left
the room she expressed herself kindly to Mrs. Alison as to the
agreeable time she had spent, and the latter said to me on coming
in, &ldquo;What did you get to say to Miss Strickland all this
time?&nbsp; She says you were so agreeable, and she was two hours
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; I replied with truth;
&ldquo;I assure you I did not say six words to her the whole
time.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Agnes was a terrible one to
talk&mdash;as, indeed, all the Stricklands were.&nbsp; In Suffolk
such accomplished conversationalists were rare.</p>
<p>It must have been, now I come to think of it, a dismal old
house, suggestive of rats and dampness and mould, that Reydon
Hall, with its scantily furnished rooms and its unused attics and
its empty barns and stables, with a general air of decay all over
the place, inside and out.&nbsp; It had a dark, heavy roof and
whitewashed walls, and was externally anything but a showy place,
standing, as it did, a little way from the road.&nbsp; It must
have been a difficulty with the family to keep up the place, and
the style of living was altogether plain; yet there I heard a
good deal of literary life in London, of Thomas Pringle, the
poet, and the Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, whose
&lsquo;Residence in South Africa&rsquo; is still one of the <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>most interesting books on that quarter of the world, and
of whom Josiah Conder, one of the great men of my smaller
literary world at that time, wrote an appreciative biographical
sketch.&nbsp; Mr. Pringle, let me remind my readers, was the
original editor of <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, a magazine
which still maintains its reputation as being the best of its
class.&nbsp; Mr. Pringle, I believe, at some time or other, had
visited Wrentham; at any rate, the Stricklands, especially
Susanna, were among his intimate friends, and, from what I heard,
I could well believe, when, at a later period, I visited his
grave in Bunhill Fields, what I found recorded there&mdash;that
&lsquo;In the walks of British literature he was known as a man
of genius; in the domestic circle he was loved as an affectionate
relative and faithful friend; in the wide sphere of humanity he
was revered as the advocate and protector of the
oppressed,&rsquo; who &lsquo;left among the children of the
African desert a memorial of his philanthropy, and bequeathed to
his fellow-countrymen an example of enduring virtue.&rsquo;&nbsp;
At the home of the Pringles the Stricklands made many literary
acquaintances, such as Alaric Watts, and Mrs. S. C. Hall, and
others of whom I heard them talk.&nbsp; At that time, however,
literature was not, as far as women were <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>concerned,
the lucrative profession it has since become, and I have a dim
remembrance of their paintings&mdash;for in this respect the
Stricklands, like my own mother, were very
accomplished&mdash;being sold at the Soho Bazaar, a practice
which helped to maintain them in the respectability and comfort
becoming their position in life.&nbsp; But in London they never
forgot the old home, and wrote so much about it in their stories,
that there was not a flower, or shrub, or tree, or hedge, or
mossy bank redolent in early spring of primroses and violets, to
which they had not given, to my boyish eyes, a glory and a
charm.&nbsp; This reference to painting reminds me of a feature
of my young days, not without interest, in connection with the
name of Cunningham&mdash;a name at one time well known in the
religious world.</p>
<p>The reader must be reminded that the reverend gentleman
referred to was a <i>rara avis</i>, and that between him and the
neighbouring clergy there was little sympathy&mdash;unless the
common rallying cry of &lsquo;The Church in Danger!&rsquo; was
raised as an electioneering dodge.&nbsp; The clergyman at
Wrentham at that time, who declared himself the appointed vessel
of grace for the parish, I have been led to believe, since I have
become older, was by no <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>means a saint, and his brethren were
notorious as evil-livers.&nbsp; Some twenty years ago one of them
had his effects sold off, and his library was viewed with no
little amusement by his parishioners, to many of whom, if popular
fame be an authority, he was more than a spiritual father.&nbsp;
The library contained only one book that could be called
theological, and the title of that wonderfully unique volume was,
&lsquo;Die and be Damned; or, An End of the
Methodists.&rsquo;&nbsp; All the other books were exclusively
sporting, while the pictures were such as would have been a
disgrace to Holywell Street.&nbsp; It was of him that the clerk
said that &lsquo;next Sunday there would be no Divine sarvice, as
maaster was going to Newmarket.&rsquo;&nbsp; Once upon a time
after a sermon one of his flock approached him, as he had been
preaching on miracles, to ask him to explain what a miracle
really was.&nbsp; The reverend gentleman gave his rustic inquirer
a kick, adding, &lsquo;Did you feel that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, sir; but what of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the reverend gentleman, &lsquo;if you
had not felt it, it would have been a miracle, that is
all.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet that man was as popular as any parson in
the district, perhaps more so, and it was with some indignation
in certain quarters that the people <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>learned that
a new Bishop had come to Norwich, and that the parson had been
deprived of his living for immoral conduct.&nbsp; Of another it
is said that, calling on a poor villager, dying and full of
gloomy anticipations as to the future, all he could say was,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened; I dare say you will meet a good
many people you know.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have often heard old men
talk of the time when they used to take the parson home in a
wheelbarrow&mdash;but that was before we had a Sunday-school, at
which I was a regular teacher.&nbsp; The church had a
Sunday-school, but not till after the one in the chapel had
existed many years.&nbsp; Of these ornaments of the Church and
foes of Dissent, some had apparently a sense of shame&mdash;one
of them, at any rate, committed suicide.</p>
<p>At Pakefield, some seven miles from Wrentham, and just on the
borders of Lowestoft, then, as now, the most eastern extremity of
England, resided the Rev. Francis Cunningham.&nbsp; He was a
clergyman of piety and philanthropy, rare at that time in that
benighted district, and in this respect he was aided by his wife,
a little dark woman whom I well remember, a sister of the
far-famed John Joseph Gurney, of Earlham.&nbsp; It is with
pleasure I quote the following from the Journal of Caroline <!--
page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Fox: &lsquo;A charming story of F. Cunningham coming in
to prayers just murmuring something about the study being on
fire, and proceeding to read a long chapter and make equally long
comments thereupon.&nbsp; When the reading was over, and the fact
became public, he observed, &ldquo;Yes, I saw it was a little on
fire, but I opened the window on leaving the
room.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Cunningham had much to do with
establishing a branch of the British and Foreign Bible Society in
Paris in connection with the Buxtons.&nbsp; In this way, but on a
smaller scale, the Cunninghams were equally distinguished, and
one of the things they had established at Pakefield was an infant
school, to which I, in company with my parents&mdash;indeed, I
may add, the whole family&mdash;was taken, in order, if possible,
that our little village should possess a similar
institution.&nbsp; But my principal pilgrimages to the Pakefield
vicarage were in connection with some mission to aid Oberlin in
his grand work amongst the mountains and valleys of
Switzerland.&nbsp; It appeared Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham had
visited the good man, and watched him in his career, and had come
back to England to gain for him, if possible, sympathy and
friends.&nbsp; Mrs. Cunningham had taken drawings of the
principal objects of <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>interest, which had been
lithographed, and these lithographs my mother, who in her way was
as great an enthusiast as Susanna Strickland herself, was very
anxious to obtain; the financial position of the family, however,
forbade any thought of purchase.&nbsp; But she had a wonderful
gift of painting, and she painted while we children were learning
the Latin grammar, or preparing our lessons in the Delectus, much
to my terror, as I had a habit of restlessness which, by shaking
the table, not only impaired her work, but drew down upon me not
a little of reproach; and with these paintings I was despatched
on foot to Pakefield, where, in return for them, I was given the
famous lithographs, which were to be preserved for many a year in
the spare room we called the parlour&mdash;drawing-rooms at that
time in East Anglia were, I think, unknown.&nbsp; What a joy it
was to us children when that parlour had its fire lit, and we
found out that company was coming&mdash;partly, I must add, for
sensual reasons.&nbsp; We knew that the best tea-things were to
be used, that unusual delicacies were to be placed upon the
table, and I must do my mother the justice to say that she could
cook as well as she could paint; but for other and higher
motives, and not as an occasion <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of feasting
or for the disuse of the economical pinafore which was always
worn to keep our clothes clean, did we rejoice when we found
there was to be tea in the parlour.&nbsp; If young people were
coming, we were sure to dissect puzzles, or play some game which
combined amusement with instruction; and if the party consisted
of seniors, as on the occasion of the Book Club&mdash;almost all
Dissenting congregations had their Book Clubs then&mdash;it was a
pleasure to listen to my father&rsquo;s talk, who was a well-read
man, and who, being a Scotchman, had inherited his full share of
Scotch wit, which, however, was enlivened with quotations from
&lsquo;Hudibras,&rsquo; the only poet, alas! in whom he seemed to
take any particular interest.&nbsp; There, in the parlour, were
the fraternal meetings attended by all the neighbouring
Independent ministers, all clad in sober black, and whose wildest
exploits in rollicking debauchery were confined to a pipe and a
glass of home-made wine.&nbsp; Madeira, port and sherry were
unknown in ministers&rsquo; houses, though now and then one got a
taste of them at the houses of men better to do, and who,
perhaps, had been as far as London once or twice in their
lives.&nbsp; Of these neighbouring ministers, one of the most
celebrated at that time was the Rev. Edward <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Walford, then
of Yarmouth, who afterwards became tutor of Homerton College, and
who, after the death of a favourite and accomplished
daughter&mdash;I can still remember the gracefulness of her
person&mdash;sank into a state of profound melancholy, which led
him to shut himself from his friends, to give up all public
preaching and tutorial work, and to consider himself as
hopelessly lost.&nbsp; It is a curious fact that he dated his
return to reason and happiness and usefulness after a visit paid
him by my father, who happened to be in town, and who naturally
was drawn to see his afflicted friend, with whom, in the days of
auld lang syne, he had smoked many a pipe and held many an
argument respecting Edwards on Freedom of the Will, and his
favourite McKnight.&nbsp; Mrs. Walford, who was aware of my
father&rsquo;s intended visit, had thoughtfully prepared pipes
and tobacco, and placed them on the table of the room where the
interview was to take place.&nbsp; My father went and smoked his
pipe and talked as usual, poor Mr. Walford sitting sad and
dejected, and refusing to be comforted all the while.&nbsp; When
my father had left&mdash;owing, I suppose, to the force of old
associations&mdash;actually the poor man approached the table,
took up a pipe, filled it with tobacco, and smoked <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>it.&nbsp; From that hour, strange to say, he recovered,
wrote a translation of the Psalms, became a trustee of
Coward&rsquo;s College, and took charge of a church at
Uxbridge.&nbsp; This is &lsquo;a fac,&rsquo; as Artemus Ward
would say, and &lsquo;facs&rsquo; are stubborn things.&nbsp; Of
this Mr. Walford, the well-known publisher of that name in St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard was a son, and the firm of Hodder and
Stoughton may be said to carry on his business, though on a
larger scale.</p>
<p>Dressed in rusty black, with hats considerably the worse for
wear, with shoes not ignorant of the cobbler&rsquo;s art,
unconscious of and careless for the fashions of the world, rarely
in London, except on the occasion of the May Meetings&mdash;no
one can tell, except those who, like myself, were admitted behind
the scenes, as it were, how these good men lived to keep alive
the traditions of freedom, civil and religious, in districts most
under the sway of the ignorant squire and the equally ignorant
parson of the parish.&nbsp; If there has been a decency and charm
about our country life it is due to them, and them alone.&nbsp;
Perhaps, more in the country than in the crowded city is the
pernicious influence felt of sons of Belial, flushed with
insolence and wine.&nbsp; It is difficult to give the reader an
idea of the utter animalism, if I may so term it, of <!-- page
53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>rural
life some fifty years ago.&nbsp; For small wages these Dissenting
ministers did a noble work, in the way of preserving morals,
extending education, promoting religion, and elevating the aim
and tone of |the little community in which they lived, and moved,
and had their being.&nbsp; At home the difficulties of such of
them as had large families were immense.&nbsp; The pocket was
light, and too often there was but little in the larder.&nbsp;
But they laboured on through good and bad report, and now they
have their reward.&nbsp; Perhaps one of their failings was that
they kept too much the latter end in view, and were too
indifferent to present needs and requirements.&nbsp; They did not
try to make the best of both worlds.&nbsp; I can never forget a
remark addressed to me by all the good men of the class with whom
I was familiar in my childhood as to the need of getting on in
life and earning an honest penny, and becoming independent in a
pecuniary point of view.&nbsp; I was to be a good boy, to love
the Lord, to study the Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism, to read the
Bible, as if outside the village there was no struggle into which
sooner or later I should have to plunge&mdash;no hard battle with
the world to fight, no temporal victory to win.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Yarmouth bloaters&mdash;George
Borrow&mdash;The town fifty years ago&mdash;The distinguished
natives.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-thinking you&rsquo;ll be wanting half a
pint of beer by this time, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such were the first words I heard as I left the hotel where I
was a temporary sojourner about nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Of
course I turned to look at the speaker.&nbsp; He wore an oilskin
cap, with a great flap hanging over the back of the neck; his
oilskin middle was encased in a thick blue guernsey; his trousers
were hidden in heavy jack-boots, which came up above his knees;
his face was red, and his body was almost as round as that of a
porpoise.&nbsp; When I add that the party addressed was similarly
adorned and was of a similar build, the reader will guess at once
that I was amongst a seafaring community, and let me add that
this supposition is correct.&nbsp; I was, in fact, at Lowestoft,
and Lowestoft just now <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>is, with Yarmouth, the headquarters
of the herring fishery.&nbsp; The truth is, as the poet tells us,
&lsquo;Things are not what they seem,&rsquo; and that many of the
Yarmouth bloaters which we are in the habit of indulging in at
breakfast in reality come from Lowestoft.</p>
<p>It is worth going from London at the season of the year when
the finest bloaters are being caught, to realize the peril and
the enterprise and the industry connected with the herring trade,
which employs some five hundred boats, manned by seven to twelve
men, who work the business on the cooperative system, which, when
the season is a good one, gives a handsome remuneration to all
concerned, and which drains the country of young men for miles
around.&nbsp; Each boat is furnished with some score of nets, and
each net extends more than thirty-two yards.&nbsp; The boat puts
off according to the tide, and if it gets a good haul, at once
returns to the harbour with its freight; if the catch is
indifferent, the boat stays out; the fish are salted as they are
caught, and then the boat, generally at a distance of about
twenty miles from the shore, waits till a sufficient number have
been caught to complete the cargo.&nbsp; When that is the case,
the boat at once makes for Lowestoft, and the fish are unloaded
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>under a shed in heaps of about half a last (a last is
professedly 10,000 herrings, but really much more).&nbsp; At nine
a bell rings and the various auctioneers commence
operations.&nbsp; A crowd is formed, and in a very few minutes a
lot is sold off to traders who are well known, and who pay at the
end of the week.&nbsp; The auctioneer then proceeds to the next
group, which is disposed of in a similar way.&nbsp; Other
auctioneers in various parts of the enormous shed erected for
their accommodation do the same, and then, as more boats arrive,
other cargoes are sold, the sailors bringing a hundred as a
sample from the boat.&nbsp; And thus all day long the work of
selling goes on, and as soon as a lot are sold they are packed up
with ice, if fresh, or with more salt, if already salted, and
despatched by train to various quarters of England, where, it is
to be presumed, they meet with a speedy and immediate sale.&nbsp;
In this way as many as one hundred and ninety-eight trucks are
sometimes sent off in a single day.&nbsp; But in London we are
familiar with the kipper, the red herring, and the Yarmouth
bloater, and to see how they are prepared for consumption I leave
the market&mdash;always wet and fishy and slippery&mdash;and make
my way to the extensive premises on the <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>beach
belonging to Mr. Thomas Brown&mdash;the only Brown whose name is
familiar to the fish-dealer in every market in England, and the
extent of whose business may be best realized by the reader when
I state that Mr. Brown sends off from his factory as many as
forty lasts a week.</p>
<p>An intelligent foreman, after I have evaded the attack of a
formidable dog which keeps watch and ward over the premises,
explains to me the mystery of the trade.&nbsp; I find myself in
the midst of a square.&nbsp; On one side are a great stack of oak
and many casks of old salt.&nbsp; The latter, I gather, is sold
to be used as manure.&nbsp; The former is applied to the fire,
which gently smokes the Yarmouth bloater.&nbsp; On one side, the
herrings, as they are received, are pickled&mdash;that is, first
washed in fresh water, and then immersed in great tubs in which
the water is mixed with salt.&nbsp; The next thing is to take
them into a room in which several women are engaged in spitting
them&mdash;that is, hanging them on rods&mdash;and then they are
carried to the apartment where they are hung up, while oak logs
are burnt beneath.&nbsp; In twelve hours they are sufficiently
smoked, and then you have the real Yarmouth bloater.&nbsp; I am
glad I have seen the process, as I have a horrible suspicion that
the <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>costermonger manufactures many a Yarmouth bloater in
some filthy Whitechapel slum, the odour of which by no means
tends to improve the flavour of so delicate a fish.</p>
<p>But we have to discuss the red-herring, not of the artful
politician, anxious to dodge his hearers, but of the
breakfast-table.&nbsp; For this purpose I am taken to a large
oven filled with oak sawdust, gathered from Ipswich, and oak
shavings, which are also brought from a distance, principally
from Bass&rsquo;s Brewery, and, indeed, from all the great works
where oak is used; I see heaps of fire made from these ashes,
which give out much heat, and at the same time much smoke.&nbsp;
In a loft above are hung the herrings, and there they hang twelve
days, till they gradually become of the colour of a guinea, when
they are packed up and sent away in casks, while the bloaters go
away in baskets of a hundred, in pots holding a smaller number,
and in barrels in which as many as three hundred are stowed
away.&nbsp; As to the kippered herring, he undergoes quite a
different treatment.&nbsp; Some twenty or thirty women get hold
of him, cut him open, take out his gut and wash him, and then he
is hung over an oak fire and smoked for twelve hours, and thus,
saturated with smoke inside and out, is regarded in <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>many
circles as a delicacy to be highly prized.&nbsp; But he must be
got off the premises.&nbsp; Well, if we climb to a loft, we shall
see a good many young women hard at work stripping the rods, on
which he and his fellows have been suspended, and stowing the
fish away.&nbsp; In the autumn especially the peculiar industries
connected with the trade are very considerably exercised.&nbsp;
All day long carts come in with the fish; all day long carts go
out with the manufactured articles to the railway-station; day
and night the men and women are at work; in one quarter the women
make and mend the nets, which are then boiled in cutch and put on
board the boats; in another quarter coopers are at work making
boxes and casks and barrels.&nbsp; As to the baskets, the country
is ransacked for them, and as soon as they are filled they take
the train and away they go, to give a flavour to the potato
dinner of the poor man, or to form a tasty adjunct to the dishes
under which the breakfast table of his lord and master
groans.&nbsp; In London we get the best&mdash;the smaller
herrings go to the North, as the dwellers in those parts will not
pay the price the Londoner does.&nbsp; Great is the joy and
rejoicing, as well can be imagined, at Lowestoft when the herring
season comes on.&nbsp; It is true, the Lowestoft <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>fishers do not have it all to themselves.&nbsp; Yarmouth
is a fierce rival in the race, and, as it has now superior
accommodation, many a boat makes for that far-famed port.&nbsp;
Then, the Scotch, when they have done their fishing, make for the
English coast, and manage, as Scotchmen ever do, to gather a fair
share of the spoil.&nbsp; As to the foreigners, they are not such
formidable rivals as sometimes we are apt to believe.&nbsp; The
Frenchman or the Dutchman comes, but that is when he is blown off
by a gale from his own happy hunting-ground, and then we know,
all the world over, the cry is, &lsquo;Any port in a
storm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh, these storms! how terrible they are! and how little, as we
eat our Yarmouth bloater of a morning, or spread the
bloater-paste as a covering to the thin slice of
bread-and-butter, to tempt the languid appetite&mdash;how little
do we who sit at home at ease realize their fury and their
power!&nbsp; As I now write, twenty-one orphans are bewailing the
loss of fathers who went out in a craft during the last gale, and
of whom no sign has been seen, nor ever will.&nbsp; Hour by hour
the women, weeping and watching on the sandy shore, saw one and
another familiar boat come, more or less buffeted, into
port.&nbsp; On more than one a hand had been washed away, <!--
page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>but the craft and the rest of the crew were saved
somehow.&nbsp; But one boat yet remained missing, and in vain the
survivors were questioned as to what had become of the <i>Skimmer
of the Sea</i>.&nbsp; Day by day anxious eyes swept the distant
horizon.&nbsp; Day by day a sadder weight came down on weeping
child and broken-hearted wife; and now all hope is gone, and all
felt that in the fury of the gale the <i>Skimmer of the Sea</i>
foundered with all her hands.&nbsp; Well, as the good old Admiral
said, as he and his men were about to perish, &lsquo;My lads, the
way to heaven is as short by sea as by land.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the
wounded heart in the agony of its grief is slow to realize that
fact.&nbsp; Sailors ought to be serious men; every halfpenny they
earn is won at the risk of a life.&nbsp; In Lowestoft, I am glad
to find, many of them are.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Salvation Army has
done &rsquo;em a deal of good,&rsquo; says a decent woman, with
whom I happened to scrape an acquaintance at the most attractive
coffee-house I have ever seen&mdash;the Coffee Pot at Mutford
Bridge.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not that I holds with the Salvation Army
myself, sir, but they&rsquo;ve done the men a deal of good, and
they don&rsquo;t spend their wages, as they used to do, in
drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lowestoft, when I was there last, had just lost <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>one
of its heroes&mdash;I mean the late Mr. George Borrow&mdash;whose
&lsquo;Bible in Spain&rsquo; was the talk of the season in
religious and worldly circles alike, and whose writings on
Gipsies and Wild Wales and the &lsquo;Bible in Spain&rsquo;
achieved at one time an enormous popularity.&nbsp; He
lived&mdash;I can still remember his tall form&mdash;on a bank a
couple of miles out of Lowestoft, sloping down to a large piece
of water known in those parts as Oulton Broad.&nbsp; The tourist,
if he looks to his right just after he has passed Mutford Bridge
on the rail from Lowestoft to Beccles, across the wide sheet of
water, which, as I saw it last, lay calm and blue in the fading
glory of an autumnal sun, will perhaps see a white house at a
distance, nestled in among the fir-trees&mdash;that was where
George Borrow lived, and where he died, though he was buried in
Brompton Cemetery by the side of his wife.&nbsp; You cannot make
a mistake, for houses are rare in those parts.&nbsp; As his
step-daughter observed to me, the proper way is by water; to get
to the house by land&mdash;at least as I did&mdash;you walk along
the rail for a couple of miles, then break off across a bit of a
swamp, to a little lane that conducts you to Oulton
Church&mdash;a very ancient one, which, however, is in a state of
good repair and is noted partly on account of the <!-- page
63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>fact
that the steeple is built in the middle, and partly on account of
its containing, so it is said, the earliest example of a brass to
an ecclesiastic which is to be found in England.&nbsp; A narrow
path from the church leads you to Oulton Hall, which came into
the possession of Borrow by marriage, really a very plain,
red-brick, capacious, comfortable-looking old farmhouse, only of
a superior class.&nbsp; Keeping the Hall to the right, you reach
a gate, which opens into a very narrow lane, full of mud in the
winter and dust in the summer.&nbsp; The lane loses itself in the
marshland, on the borders of Lake Lothing&mdash;a name supposed
to have been derived from a certain Danish prince, murdered on
the spot by a jealous Court retainer; and it is a fitting place
for a murder, as in that lonely district there was no eye to
pity, no ear to hear, no hand to save.&nbsp; Even to-day, as you
look away from the train, there is little sign of life, save the
sail of a distant wherry as it makes sluggishly for Norwich or
Beccles, as it goes either into the Waveney or the Yare; or the
gray wing of the heron as it flies heavily along the marsh; and
that is all.&nbsp; Far away, perhaps, rises a ridge, with a house
on it; or a steeple, with a few trees struggling to yield the
barren spot a shelter from the suns of summer <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>or the
howling winds of winter; but all is still life there, and the
habitations of men are few and far between.&nbsp; In the
particular lane to which I have introduced the reader&mdash;there
are but two&mdash;there is a little cottage on your left, and
beyond, under a group of trees, mostly fir, which almost hide it
from view, a home of a rather superior character, in a very
dilapidated condition, with everything around it more or less
untidy&mdash;that was where George Borrow lived and worked in his
way for many a long day.&nbsp; The step-daughter and her husband
reside there now&mdash;very ancient people, who are to be seen
driving about Lowestoft in a little wicker car, drawn by an
amiable and active donkey, an aged dog guarding the cottage
during their temporary absence.&nbsp; The female, an ancient one,
who did for the house, lives in the little cottage which the
tourist will have already observed, and the interior of which
presented, when I peeped in, a far greater idea of comfort than
did Oulton Cottage, the residence of the late George
Borrow.&nbsp; The picture one gets is rather a melancholy
one.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a funny-tempered man&rsquo;&mdash;that
seems to have been the idea of the few people around.&nbsp;
Latterly he kept no company, and no one came to see him.&nbsp;
All who did call on him, however, tell <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>me that he
was well dressed, but that all the interior of the house was
dirty.&nbsp; Well, that was to be expected of a man who loved to
live with the gipsies, and patter to them in Romany of Egyptian
lore, for it could not have been want of means.&nbsp; Borrow must
have made a good deal of money by his books, and I have heard his
landed property estimated at five hundred per year.&nbsp; The
house looked like the residence of a miser who would not lay out
a penny in keeping up appearances or in repairs.&nbsp; It must be
remembered, however, that the grand old man had long become bowed
with age; that for some years before his death he was scarcely
able to move himself without help; that the grasshopper, as it
were, had become a burden.&nbsp; In summer time such a residence,
in good repair and well furnished, would be perfectly
charming.&nbsp; The house contains a sitting-room on each side of
the entrance-hall.&nbsp; Behind is the kitchen, and above are
four bedrooms and two attics&mdash;none of them large, I own, but
at any rate capable of being made very cosy.&nbsp; On your right,
in a little niche in the cliff, is a small stable.&nbsp; Lower
down is a large summer-house, then full of books (amongst them, I
believe, there were a hundred lexicons), where their learned
proprietor loved to write.&nbsp; <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Farther down
the lawn you come to the lake, where Borrow could enjoy his
morning bath without fear of being disturbed, and where any
amount of fish can be got.&nbsp; Just previous to my last visit
to the spot a pike of more than twenty pounds&rsquo;
weight&mdash;I am afraid to say how many pounds more, lest the
reader should think I was exaggerating&mdash;had been
caught.&nbsp; For a real angler or sportsman such a house as that
in which George Borrow spent the latter years of his long life
must have been a perfect paradise.&nbsp; The world is utterly
away from you, and, what is better still, in such a spot the
world has no chance of finding you out.&nbsp; Approaching by
road, you see no sign of the house till you are in it, so
completely is it hidden in the nook of trees in which it
stands.&nbsp; Only to the water is it open.&nbsp; It would be
really beautiful to live there in the summer, and have a gondola
to row into Beccles or Lowestoft or Bungay when you wanted to be
gay.</p>
<p>One good anecdote I heard of George Borrow the last time I was
in the neighbourhood, which is worth repeating.&nbsp; My
informant was an Independent minister, at that time supplying the
pulpit at Lowestoft, and staying at Oulton Hall, then inhabited
by a worthy Dissenting tenant.&nbsp; One <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>night a
meeting of the Bible Society was held at Mutford Bridge, at which
the party from the Hall attended, and where George Borrow was one
of the speakers.&nbsp; After the meeting was over, all the
speakers went back to supper at Oulton Hall, and my friend among
them, who, in the course of the supper, found himself attacked
very violently by the clergyman for holding Calvinistic
opinions.&nbsp; Naturally my friend replied that the clergyman
was bound to do the same.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you make that
out?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, the Articles of your Church are
Calvinistic, and to them you have sworn assent.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh yes, but there is a way of explaining them
away.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How so?&rsquo; said my friend.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied the clergyman, &lsquo;we are not bound
to take the words in their natural sense.&rsquo;&nbsp; My friend,
an honest, blunt East Anglian, intimated that he did not
understand that way of evading the difficulty; but he was then a
young man, and did not like to continue the discussion
further.&nbsp; However, George Borrow, who had not said a word
hitherto, entered into the discussion, opening fire on the
clergyman in a very unexpected manner, and giving him such a
setting down as the hearers, at any rate, never forgot.&nbsp; All
the sophistry about the non-natural meaning of terms was held up
by <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Borrow to ridicule, even contempt; and the clergyman was
beaten at every point.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; says my friend,
&lsquo;did I hear one man give another such a dressing as on that
occasion.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not always, however, that Borrow
thus shone.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood of Bungay lived a
gentleman much given to collect around him men of literary taste
and culture.&nbsp; A lecture was to be given in the
neighbourhood, and all the men of light and leading around were
invited.&nbsp; George Borrow was one of the earliest arrivals,
and seated himself before the fire with a book in his hand, over
which he nodded superciliously, as the host brought up all his
guests in succession to be introduced to the lion of the
town.&nbsp; At dinner which followed, which was rather a jovial
one, and at which the bottle went round freely, so loud and
general was the conversation that my friend, a clever lawyer,
with remarkably good ears, was quite unable to catch a sentence
from the great author&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; Perhaps Borrow really
did say nothing, or next to nothing.&nbsp; It is quite as likely
that he did as not, as I have already informed the reader that
&lsquo;he was a funny-tempered man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine Gurney,&rsquo; writes Caroline Fox,
&lsquo;gave us a note to George Borrow, so on him we
called&mdash;<!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>a tall, ungainly man, with great
physical strength, quick, penetrating eye, a confident manner,
and a disagreeable tone and pronunciation.&rsquo;&nbsp; We gather
from the same lady that it was Joseph John Gurney who recommended
George Borrow to the Committee of the Bible Society.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So he stalked up to London, and they gave him a hymn to
translate into the Manchow language, and the same to one of their
people to translate also.&nbsp; When compared they proved to be
very different.&nbsp; When put before their reader, he had the
candour to say that Borrow&rsquo;s was much the better of the
two.&nbsp; On this they sent him to Petersburg to get it printed,
and then gave him business in Portugal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One thing is clear&mdash;that Borrow was a lonely man, and
evidently one who did not hold the resources of civilization in
such esteem as Mr. Gladstone does.&nbsp; He loved Nature and her
ways, and people like the gipsies, who are supposed to be of a
similar way of thinking.&nbsp; He eschewed the hum of cities and
the roar of the &lsquo;madding crowd.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was big in
body and in mind, and wanted elbow-room; and yet what would he
have been if he had not lived in a city, and come under the
stimulative influence of such men as Edward Taylor, of <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Norwich?&nbsp; It is idle to complain of cities, however
they sully the air, and deface the land, and pollute the water,
and rear the weak and vicious and the wicked&mdash;to remind us
how low and depraved human nature can become when it is cut off
from communion with Nature and Nature&rsquo;s God.&nbsp; Borrow
owed much to cities, and was best appreciated by the men who
dwelt in them.&nbsp; There is often a good deal of affectation
about the love of rural solitude, nor does it often last long
when there is a wife to have a voice in the matter.&nbsp; Yet in
Borrow undoubtedly the feeling was sincere, and of him Wordsworth
might have written&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As in the eye of Nature he has lived,<br />
So in the eye of Nature let him die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lowestoft was a frequent attraction for a youthful
ramble&mdash;perhaps almost too far, unless one could manage to
get a lift in a little yellow-painted black-bodied vehicle called
a whisky, which was grandfather&rsquo;s property, and into the
shafts of which could be put any spare quadruped, whether donkey,
or mule, or pony, it mattered little, and which afforded a
considerable relief when a trip as far as Lowestoft was
determined on.&nbsp; At that time there was no harbour, and the
town consisted simply of one High Street, gradually rising
towards the north, <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>with a fine space for boys to play in
between the cliff and the sea, called the denes.&nbsp; I can well
remember being taken to view the works of the harbour before the
water was let in, and not a little astonished at what then was to
me a new world of engineering science and skill.&nbsp; In the
High Street there was a little old-fashioned and by no means
flourishing Independent Chapel, where at one time the preacher
was the Rev. Mr. Maurice, the father of the Mr. Maurice to whom
many owe a great awakening of spiritual life, and whose memory
they still regard as that of a beloved and honoured
teacher.&nbsp; Mr. Maurice was a Unitarian, I believe, and, when
he retired, handed over the chapel to my father with the remark
that it was no use his preaching there any longer.&nbsp; The
preacher in my time was the Rev. George Steffe Crisp, a kindly,
timid, tearful man, always in difficulties with his people, and
who often resorted to Wrentham for advice.&nbsp; Latterly he
retired from the ministry, and kept a shop and school.&nbsp; In
this capacity one day my old friend John Childs, of Bungay, the
far-famed printer&mdash;of whom I shall have much to say
anon&mdash;called on him, when the following dialogue took place:
&lsquo;Good-morning, Mr. Crisp.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-morning,
Mr. Childs.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, how <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>are you
getting on?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, very well; but there is one
thing that troubles me much.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
that?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That I am getting deaf, and can&rsquo;t
hear my minister.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; was the cynical
reply, &lsquo;you ought to be thankful for your
privileges.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lowestoft is reported to have been a fishing station as early
as the time of the Romans; but the ancient town is supposed to
have been long engulfed by the resistless sea, for there was to
be seen till the 25th of Henry VIII. the remains of an old house
upon an inundated spot&mdash;left dry at low water about four
furlongs east of the present beach.&nbsp; The town has been the
birthplace of many distinguished men&mdash;of Sir Thomas Allen,
for instance, who was steadily attached to the Royal cause, and
who after the Restoration rose high in command, and won many a
victory over the Dutch and the Algerines; of Sir Andrew Leake,
who fell in the attack on Gibraltar; of Rear-Admiral Richard
Utbar, also a renowned fighter when England and Holland were at
war.&nbsp; To the same town also belong Admiral Sir John Ashby,
who died in 1693, and his nephew Vice-Admiral James
Mighells.&nbsp; Nor must we fail to do justice to Thomas Nash, a
facetious writer of considerable reputation in the latter part of
the sixteenth <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>century.&nbsp; The most witty of his
productions is a satirical pamphlet in praise of red herrings,
intended as a joke upon the great staple of Yarmouth, and the
pretensions of that place to superiority over Lowestoft.&nbsp; It
must be confessed that Nash is chiefly famous as a caustic
pamphleteer and an unscrupulous satirist.&nbsp; For illustration
we may point to his battle with Gabriel Harvey, the friend of
Edmund Spenser, who desired that he might be epitaphed the
inventor of the not yet naturalized English hexameter; and his
other battle with Martin Mar Prelate, or the writer or writers
who passed under that name, and who have acquired a reputation to
which poor Nash can lay no claim.&nbsp; His one conspicuous
dramatic effort is &lsquo;Summer&rsquo;s Last Will and
Testament.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nash wrote for bare existence&mdash;to
use his own words, &lsquo;contending with the cold, and
conversing with scarcity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nash lived in an
unpropitious age.&nbsp; A recent French writer has placed him in
the foremost rank of English writers.&nbsp; Dr. Jusserand, the
author referred to, in his accounts of the English novel in the
time of Shakespeare, tells us Nash was the most successful
exponent in England of the picturesque novel.&nbsp; The
picturesque novel is the forerunner of the realistic novel of
modern <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>times.&nbsp; It portrays the life and
fortunes of the picaro&mdash;the adventurer who tries all roads
to fortune.&nbsp; Spanish in its origin, it developed into a
school in which Defoe and Thackeray distinguished
themselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nash,&rsquo; writes the French author,
&lsquo;mingled serious scenes with his comedy, in order that his
romances might more nearly resemble real life.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
fact (he writes), &lsquo;Nash does not only possess the merit of
learning how to observe the ridiculous side of human nature, and
of portraying in a full light picturesque figures&mdash;now
worthy of Teniers and now of Callot&mdash;some fat and greasy,
others lean and lank; he possesses a thing very rare with the
picturesque school, the faculty of being moved.&nbsp; He seems to
have foreseen the immense field of study which was to be opened
later to the novelist.&nbsp; A distant ancestor of Fielding, as
Lilly and Sidney appear to us to be distant ancestors of
Richardson, he understands that a picture of active life,
reproducing only in the Spanish fashion scenes of comedy, is
incomplete and departs from reality.&nbsp; The greatest jesters,
the most arrogant, the most venturesome, have their days of
anguish.&nbsp; No hero has ever yet remained imprisoned from the
cradle to the grave, and no one has been able to live an
irresponsible spectator, <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>and not feel
his heart sometimes beat the quicker, nor bow his head
unmoved.&nbsp; Nash caught a glimpse of this.&rsquo;&nbsp; As an
illustration, Dr. Jusserand points to his &lsquo;Jack
Wilton&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The best specimen of the picturesque
tale in English literature anterior to Defoe.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
Lowestoft they ought to keep his memory green.</p>
<p>The writer well remembers the day when Mr., afterwards Sir,
Morton Peto, assembled the inhabitants of Lowestoft in the then
dilapidated Town Hall, and promised that if they would sell their
ruined harbour works, and back him in making a railway, their
mackerel and herrings should be delivered almost alive in
Manchester, Liverpool, and London.&nbsp; The inhabitants believed
in the power of the enchanter, and Lowestoft is
metamorphosed.&nbsp; The old town remains upon its beautiful
eminence, and memory clings to the cliffs and to the denes,
tenanted only, the one by wild rabbits, the other by the merry
children and the nets of the fishermen.&nbsp; But a new town has
grown up around the harbour&mdash;a grand hotel, excellent
lodging-houses, a new church; a great population have upset the
romance, and borne witness to the spirit of enterprise which
characterizes this generation.&nbsp; The new town has spread to
Kirkley, has Londonized even <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>quiet
Pakefield, and awakened a sleeping neighbourhood to what men call
life.</p>
<p>At Lowestoft commence what are known to sailors as the
Yarmouth Roads&mdash;a grand stretch of sea protected by the
sands, where an armada might anchor secure; and it was a sight
not to be seen now, when gigantic steamers do all the business of
the sea, to watch the hundreds of ships that would come inside
the Roads at certain seasons of the year.&nbsp; There, in the
winter-time&mdash;that is, from Lowestoft to Covehithe&mdash;I
have seen the beach strewed with wrecks, chiefly of rotten
colliers, or ships in the corn trade; but inside &lsquo;Lowestoft
Roads,&rsquo; to which they were guided by a lighthouse on the
cliff, they were supposed to be secure.&nbsp; Lowestoft at that
time, with its charming sands, was little known to the gay world,
and depended far more on the fishing than the bathing
season.&nbsp; The former was a busy time, and kept all the
country round in a state of excitement.&nbsp; Many were the men,
for instance, who, even as far off as Wrentham, went herring or
mackerel fishing in the big craft, which, drawn up on the beach
when the season was over, seemed to me ships such as never had
been seen by the mariners of Tyre and Sidon; but the chief
interest to me were the vans <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>in which the
fish were carried from Lowestoft to London&mdash;light
spring-carts with four wheels and two horses, that, after
changing horses at our Spread Eagle, raced like lightning along
the turnpike-road, at all hours, and even on Sundays&mdash;a sad
grievance to the godly&mdash;beating the Yarmouth mail.</p>
<p>Now and then, even at that remote period, when railways were
not, and when Lowestoft was no port, nothing but a
fishing-station, distinguished people came to Lowestoft,
attracted by its bracing air and exceptional bathing
attractions.&nbsp; I can in this way recollect Sir Edward Parry
and M. Guizot.&nbsp; But there were other personages equally
distinguished.&nbsp; One of these was Mrs. Siddons, with whom an
old Dissenting minister&mdash;the Rev. S. Sloper, of Beccles,
whom I can well remember&mdash;contracted quite an
intimacy.&nbsp; She had already passed the zenith of her
celebrity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Providence,&rsquo; writes my friend, Mr.
Wilton Rix, of Beccles, in his &lsquo;East Anglian
Nonconformity,&rsquo; published as far back as 1851, &lsquo;had
repeatedly and recently called her to tread in domestic life the
path of sorrow, and her religious advantages, however few, had
taught her that</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;That
path alone<br />
Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sweet, sometimes,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;are the uses of adversity.&nbsp; It not only strengthens
family affection, but it teaches us all to walk humbly with
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not surprising that she was disposed to
cultivate the society of those who could blend piety with
cheerfulness, and with whom she might be on friendly terms
without ceremony.&nbsp; Such acquaintances she found in Mr.
Sloper&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Mrs. Siddons, with unassuming
kindness, contributed to their amusement by specimens of her
powerful reading.&nbsp; She joined willingly in the worship of
the family, and maintained the same invaluable practice at her
own lodgings.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Rix continues: &lsquo;Just at that
time Mr. Sloper was requested to preach to his own people on an
affecting and mournful occasion, the death of a suicide.&nbsp;
Though he keenly felt the delicacy and difficulty of the task, a
sense of duty and a possibility of usefulness overcame his
scruples.&nbsp; He selected for his text the impressive sentiment
of the Apostle, &ldquo;The sorrow of the world worketh
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Siddons was one of his auditors.&nbsp;
She, who had been the honoured guest of Royalty, who had been
enthroned as the Tragic Muse, and whose voice had charmed
applauding multitudes, was seen in the humble Dissenting
meeting-house at Beccles shedding abundant and unaffected tears
at <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>the plain and faithful exhibition of religious
truth.&nbsp; Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s preaching was as powerfully
recommended to her by the delightful illustration of Christian
principles exhibited in his private character, as by the
intrinsic importance of those principles, and the simple gravity
and penetrating earnestness with which they were announced from
his lips.&nbsp; He afterwards procured for her, at her request, a
copy of Scott&rsquo;s admirable &ldquo;Commentary on the
Bible,&rdquo; which he accompanied with a letter, warmly urging
upon her attention the great realities her profession had so
manifest a tendency to exclude from her contemplations.&nbsp;
Mrs. Siddons,&rsquo; again I quote Mr. Rix, &lsquo;more than once
expressed her gratitude for the interest Mr. Sloper had evinced
in her eternal welfare; she thanked him in writing for the advice
he had given her, adding an emphatic wish that God might enable
her to follow it&mdash;a wish which her pious and amiable
correspondent echoed with all the fervour of his heart.&nbsp; She
returned into the glare of popularity, but a hope may easily be
indulged that the pressure of subsequent relative afflictions and
of old age were not permitted to come upon her unaccompanied by
the impressions and consolations of true religion.&nbsp; Her
elegant biographer, Mr. Campbell, draws a veil <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>over the
state of her mind during her last hours, which it would be deeply
interesting to penetrate.&nbsp; Would she not then, if reason
were undimmed, reflect upon the faithful counsel she received
with Scott&rsquo;s Bible as being of infinitely greater value
than the applause of myriads or the fame of ages?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Beccles, where this good Mr. Sloper lived, and where the
writer of this extract was a respectable solicitor&mdash;I
believe the firm of Rix and Son still exists&mdash;was a small
market town about eight miles from Wrentham, inland.&nbsp; At
that time it ranked as the third town in Suffolk.&nbsp; Towards
the west it is skirted by a cliff, once washed by the estuary
which separated the eastern portions of Norfolk and
Suffolk.&nbsp; There is every reason to believe that ages back
the mouth of the Yare was an estuary or arm of the sea, and
extended with considerable magnitude for many miles up the
country.&nbsp; The herring fishery was thus a principal source of
emolument to the inhabitants, and in the time of the Conqueror
the fee farm rent of the manor of Beccles to the King was 60,000
herrings, and in the time of the Confessor 20,000.&nbsp; About
956 the manor and advowson of Beccles were granted by King Edwy
to the monks of Bury, and remained in <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>their
possession until the dissolution of the religious houses under
Henry VIII.</p>
<p>As I have said, and as I repeat, in these languid
days&mdash;when the old creeds have lost their power and the old
bottles are bursting with new wine&mdash;the glory of East Anglia
was that it was the first to stand up in the face of priest or
king for the truth&mdash;or what it held to be such.&nbsp;
Amongst the early martyrs under Mary were three burnt at
Beccles&mdash;Thomas Spicer, of Winston, labourer, John Deny, and
Edmond Poole.&nbsp; This was in the year 1556.&nbsp; Their crime
in the indictment, drawn up by Dr. Hopton, Bishop of Norwich, and
his Chancellor, Dunning, according to Fox, was:</p>
<p>&lsquo;1.&nbsp; First was articulate against them that they
belieued not the Pope of Rome to bee supreame head immediately in
Christ on earth of the Universall Catholike Church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2.&nbsp; That they belieued not holie bread and holie
water, ashes, palmes, and all other like ceremonies used in the
Church to bee good and laudable for stirring up the people to
devotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3.&nbsp; Item that they belieued not afterwards of
consecration spoken by the priest, the very naturall body of
Christ, and no other substance of bread and wine to bee in the
Sacrament of the altar.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&lsquo;4.&nbsp; Item that they belieued it to bee
idolatry to worship Christ in the Sacrament of the altar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5.&nbsp; Item that they tooke bread and wine in
remembrance of Christ&rsquo;s Passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;6.&nbsp; Item that they would not followe the crosse in
procession nor bee confessed to a priest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;7.&nbsp; Item that they affirmed no mortal man to have
in himself free will to do good or evill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It appears that the writ had not come down, nevertheless these
brave men were burnt at the stake.&nbsp; &lsquo;When they
came,&rsquo; continues Fox, &lsquo;to the reciting of the creed,
Sir John Silliard spake to them, &ldquo;That is well said,
sirs.&nbsp; I am glad to heare you saie you do belieue the
Catholike Church; that is the best word I heard of you
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To which his sayings Edmond Poole answered,
&ldquo;Though they belieue the Catholike Church, yet do they not
belieue in their Popish Church, which is no part of
Christ&rsquo;s Catholike Church, and, therefore, no part of their
beliefe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When they rose from praier they all went joyfullie to
the stake, and, being bound thereto, and the fire burning about
them, they praised God in such an audible voice that it was
wonderful to all those who stood bye and heard them.&nbsp; Then
one Robert Bacon, dwelling in the said Beccles, a <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>very
enemy to God&rsquo;s truth, and a persecutor of His people, being
then present, within the hearing thereof willed the tormentors to
throwe on faggots to stop the knaues breathes, as he termed them;
so hot was his burning charitie.&nbsp; But these good men, not
regarding their malice, confessed the truth, and yielded their
lives to the death for the testimonie of the same very
gloriouslie and joyfullie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These men were the precursors of that Nonconformity which has
made England the home of the free, and such men abounded in East
Anglia.&nbsp; Under Queen Elizabeth they had as bad a time of it
almost as under Queen Mary.&nbsp; For instance, we find under Dr.
Freke, Bishop of Norwich, and in the reign of glorious Queen
Bess, as her admirers term her, Mathew Hammond, a poor
ploughwright, of Hethersett, was condemned as a heretic, had his
ears cut off, and after the lapse of a week was committed, in the
Castle ditch at Norwich, to the more agonizing torment of the
flames.&nbsp; The translation of Dr. Whitgift to the See of
Canterbury was the signal for augmented rigour.&nbsp; He was
charged by his imperious mistress to restore religious
uniformity, which she confessed, notwithstanding all her
precautions, ran out of square.&nbsp; One of the <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>first
victims to this new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> was William Fleming,
Rector of Beccles.&nbsp; The living of Beccles at this period was
vested in Lady Anne Gresham, the widow of Sir Thomas Gresham, the
founder of the Royal Exchange.&nbsp; Previously to her marriage,
she was the widow of William Rede, merchant, of London and
Beccles.&nbsp; Under James I. and Bishop Wren, men of integrity
and conscience fared worse than under Queen Elizabeth, and
naturally the people thus persecuted formed themselves into a
Church.&nbsp; That in Beccles dated from 1652, and in the
covenant drawn up on the occasion we find it was resolved:</p>
<p>&lsquo;1.&nbsp; That we will for ever acknowledge and admit
the Lord to be our God in Jesus Christ, giving up ourselves to
Him to be His people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2.&nbsp; That we will alwaies endevour, through the
grace of God assisting us, to walke in all His waies and
ordinances, according to His written Word, which is the only
sufficient rule of good life for every man.&nbsp; Neither will we
suffer ourselves to be polluted by any sinful waies, either
publike or private, but endeavour to abstaine from the very
appearance of evill, giving no offence to the Jew or Gentile, or
the Churches of Christ.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3.&nbsp; That we will humbly and willingly submit <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>ourselves to the government of Christ in this
Church&mdash;in the administration of the Word, the seals, and
discipline.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4.&nbsp; That we will in all love approve our communion
as brethren by watching over one another, and as such shall be;
counsel, administer, relieve, assist, and bear with one another,
serving one another in love.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5.&nbsp; Lastly, we do not covenant or promise these
things in our own, but in Christ&rsquo;s strength; neither do we
confine ourselves to the words of this covenant, but shall at all
time account it our duty to embrace any further light or covenant
which shall be revealed to us out of God&rsquo;s Word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This covenant, however, was not to prevent in after time
censure being cast on others who, endeavouring to preserve its
spirit, were led to think differently from the majority.&nbsp;
For instance, we find in 1656 two persons, who had been members
of the Independent church at Beccles, received adult baptism, and
in so doing were considered to have given &lsquo;offence&rsquo;
to the church, and were desired to appear and give an account of
their practices.</p>
<p>At one time there was little of what we know as congregational
singing.&nbsp; In 1657 it was agreed by the Beccles church
&lsquo;that they do put in <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>practice the
ordinance of singing in the publick upon the forenoon and
afternoon of the Lord&rsquo;s daies, and that it be between
praier and sermon; and also it was agreed that the New England
translation of the Psalmes be made use of by the church at their
times of breaking of bread, and it was agreed that the next
Lord&rsquo;s day, seventh night, might be the day to enter upon
the work of singing in publick.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is interesting to
note that one of the pastors of the Beccles church was a Mr.
Nokes, who had been trained&mdash;where Calamy and many others
were trained&mdash;at the University of Utrecht, and that in the
same year in which Dr. Watts accepted the pastoral office, he
addressed to Mr. Nokes a poem on &lsquo;Friendship,&rsquo; which
is still included in the Doctor&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; Dissent,
when I was a boy, was considered low.&nbsp; We were
contemptuously termed &lsquo;pograms,&rsquo; a term of reproach
the origin of which I have never learnt.&nbsp; The landed gentry,
the small squires, the lawyers and the doctors, and the
tradespeople who pandered to their prejudices and fattened on
their patronage, were slow to say a word in favour of a
Dissenter.&nbsp; The poor who went to chapel were excluded from
many benefits enjoyed by their fellow-parishioners.&nbsp; It was
the fashion to treat them with scorn, yet I <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>have heard
one of the most excellent and finished gentlemen in the district
declare that he heard better talk in my father&rsquo;s parlour
than he did anywhere else in the neighbourhood, and I can well
believe it, for the Dissenting minister, as a rule, at that time,
was a better read man, and a more studious one, than the
clergyman of the district, in spite of his University education;
and in matters affecting the welfare of the nation, and that came
under the denomination of politics, his views were far more
rational than those of Churchmen in general, and the clergy in
particular.&nbsp; We learn from Milton&rsquo;s State Papers that
the churches of East Anglia petitioned Oliver Cromwell that the
three nations might enjoy the blessings of a godly, upright
magistracy; that they might have Courts of Judicature in their
own country; and that honest men of known fidelity and
uprightness might be authorized to determine trivial matters of
debt or difference.&nbsp; Assuredly the East Anglian
saints&mdash;the latter term was, and, strange to say, is still,
used as a term of reproach&mdash;were wise and right-thinking men
where Church government and public policy were concerned.&nbsp;
We love to read the story of the Pilgrim Fathers.&nbsp; With what
rapture Mrs. Hemans wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>&lsquo;What sought they thus afar?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright jewels of the mine?<br />
The wealth of seas? the spoils of war?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They sought a faith&rsquo;s pure shrine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, call it holy ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soil where first they trod;<br />
They left unstained what there they found&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Freedom to worship
God</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it seems to me that a greater glory was won by, and a
greater honour should be paid to, the men who did not cross the
Atlantic; who did not seek an asylum in a foreign land; who
remained at home to suffer&mdash;to die, if need be, to uphold
the rights of conscience, and to fight the good fight of
faith.&nbsp; It is not even in our tolerant, and, as we deem it,
more enlightened day, that full justice is done to these
men.&nbsp; In what calls itself good society you meet men and
women whose ancestors were Dissenters, and yet who are ashamed of
the fact&mdash;a fact of which no one can be ashamed who feels
how in East Anglia, at any rate, the religious teaching of
Dissent purified the life of the people, enlarged their political
views, and helped this great land of ours to sweep into a better
and a younger day.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Homerton academy&mdash;W. Johnson Fox,
M.P.&mdash;Politics in 1830&mdash;Anti-Corn Law
speeches&mdash;Wonderful oratory.</p>
<p>About 1830 there was, if not a good deal of actual light let
into such dark places as our Suffolk village&mdash;where it was
considered the whole duty of man, as regards the poor, to attend
church and make a bow to their betters (a rustic ceremony
generally performed by pulling the lock of hair on the forehead
with the right hand), and to be grateful for the wretched station
of life in which they were placed&mdash;at any rate, a great
shaking among the dry bones.&nbsp; One summer morning an awe fell
on the parish as it ran from one to another that the guard of the
Yarmouth and London Royal Mail had left word with the ostler at
the Spread Eagle that George the Fourth was dead; then a certain
dull sound as of cannon firing afar off had been wafted across
the German Ocean, and had <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>given rise to
mysterious speculations on the subject of Continental wars, in
which Suffolk lads might have to &lsquo;&rsquo;list&rsquo; as
&lsquo;sogers&rsquo;; and last of all there came that grand
excitement when&mdash;North and South, East and West&mdash;the
nation rose as one man to demand political and Parliamentary
Reform.&nbsp; It was a delusion, perhaps, that cry, but it was a
glorious one, nevertheless; that the millennium could be delayed
when we had Parliamentary Reform no one for a moment
doubted.&nbsp; The sad but undeniable fact that mostly men are
fools with whom beer is omnipotent had not then entered into
men&rsquo;s minds, and thus England and Scotland some sixty years
ago wore an aspect of activity and enthusiasm of which the
present generation can have no idea, and which, perhaps, can
never occur again.</p>
<p>Far away in the distant city which the Suffolk villagers
called Lunnon, there was a Suffolk lad, whose relations kept a
very little shop just by us, who was born at
Uggeshall&mdash;pronounced Ouchell by the common people&mdash;on
a very small farm, and who, as Unitarian preacher and newspaper
writer, had been and was doing his best in the good cause; but it
was not the influence of W. Johnson Fox&mdash;for it is of him I
write&mdash;that did much in our little <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>village to
leaven the mass with the leaven of Reform.&nbsp; While quite a
lad the Foxes went to Norwich, where the future preacher and
teacher worked as a weaver boy.&nbsp; In after-years it was often
my privilege to meet Mr. Fox, who had then attained no small
share of London distinction, amongst whose hearers were men,
often many of the most distinguished <i>literati</i> of the
day&mdash;such as Dickens and Forster&mdash;and who was actually
to sit in Parliament as M.P. for Oldham, where, old as he
was&mdash;and Mr. Gladstone says, &lsquo;People who wish to
succeed in Parliament should enter it young&rsquo;&mdash;he
occupied a most respectable position, all the more creditable
when you remember that Parliament, even at that recent date, was
a far more select and aristocratic assembly than any Parliament
of our day, or of the future, can possibly be.&nbsp; Mr. Fox had
been educated at Homerton Academy&mdash;as such places were then
termed (college is the word we use now)&mdash;under the good and
venerable Dr. Pye-Smith, whose &lsquo;Scripture Testimony to the
Messiah&rsquo; was supposed to have given Unitarianism a deadly
blow, but whom I chiefly remember as a very deaf old man, and one
of the first to recognise the fact that the Bible and geology
were not necessarily opposed to each other, <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>and to
welcome and proclaim the truth&mdash;at that time received with
fear and trembling, if received at all&mdash;that the God of
Nature and the God of Revelation were the same.&nbsp; There was a
good deal of free inquiry at Homerton Academy, which, however,
Mr. Fox assured me, gradually subsided into the right amount of
orthodoxy as the time came for the student to exchange his sure
and safe retreat for the fiery ordeal of the deacon and the
pew.&nbsp; My father and Johnson Fox had been fellow-students,
and for some time corresponded together.&nbsp; The correspondence
in due time, however, naturally ceased, as it was chiefly
controversial, and nothing can be more irksome than for two
people who have made up their minds, and whom nothing can change,
to be arguing continually, and the friendship between them in
some sense ceased as the one remained firm to, and the other
wandered farther and farther from, the modified Calvinism of the
Wrentham Church and pulpit, where, as in all orthodox pulpits at
that time, it was taught that men were villains by necessity, and
fools, as it were, by a Divine thrusting on; that for some a
Saviour had been crucified, that there might be a way of escape
from the wrath of an angry and unforgiving God; whilst for the
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>vast mass&mdash;to whom the name of Christ had never
been made known, to whom the Bible had never been
sent&mdash;there was an impending doom, the awful horror of which
no tongue could tell, no imagination conceive.&nbsp; But to the
last Mr. Fox&mdash;especially if you met him with his
old-fashioned hat on in the street&mdash;looked far more of a
Puritan divine than of the literary man, or the chief of the
advanced thinkers in Church and State, or an M.P.&nbsp; At a
later time what pleasure it gave me to listen to this
distinguished East Anglian as he appeared at the crowded
Anti-Corn Law meetings held in Covent Garden or Drury Lane!&nbsp;
Ungainly in figure, monotonous in tone, almost without a particle
of action, regarded as free in his religious opinions by the vast
majority of his audience, who were, at that time, prone, even in
London, to hold that Orthodoxy, like Charity, covered a multitude
of sins.&nbsp; What an orator he was!&nbsp; How smoothly the
sentences fell from his lips one after the other; with what happy
wit did he expose Protectionist fallacies, or enunciate Free
Trade principles, which up to that time had been held as the
special property of the philosopher, far too subtle to be
understood and appreciated by the mob!&nbsp; With what felicity
did he illustrate his weighty theme; with <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>what
clearness did he bring home to the people the wrong and injustice
done to every one of them by the landlord&rsquo;s attempt to keep
up his rent by a tax on corn; and then with what glowing
enthusiasm did they wait and listen for the climax, which, if
studied, and perhaps artificial, seemed like the ocean wave to
grow grander and larger the nearer it came, till it fell with
resistless force on all around.&nbsp; It seems to me like a
dream, all that distant and almost unrecorded past.&nbsp; I see
no such meetings, I hear no such orators now.&nbsp; As Mr.
Disraeli said of Lord Salisbury when he was Lord Robert Cecil,
there was a want of finish about his style, and the remark holds
good of the orator of to-day as contrasted with the platform
speaker of the past.&nbsp; It is impossible to fancy anyone in
our sober age attempting, to say nothing of succeeding in the
attempt (my remarks, of course, do not apply to Irish audiences
or Irish orators), to get an audience to rise <i>en masse</i> and
swear never to fold their arms, never to relax their efforts,
till their end was gained and victory won; yet Mr. Fox did so,
and long as I live shall I remember the night when, in response
to his impassioned appeal, the whole house&mdash;and it was
crowded to the ceiling&mdash;rose, ladies in the boxes, decent
City men in the pit, gods in <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the
gallery&mdash;to swear never to tire, never to rest, never to
slacken, till the peasant at the plough, the cotton-spinner in
the mill, the collier in the mine, the lone widow stitching for
life far into the early morning in her wretched garret, and the
pauper in his still more wretched cellar, ate their untaxed
loaf.&nbsp; As the &lsquo;Publicola&rsquo; of the <i>Weekly
Dispatch</i>, Mr. Fox laboured to the end of his life in the good
cause of Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform.&nbsp; It is not right
that his memory should remain unrecorded&mdash;his life assuredly
was an interesting one.&nbsp; Harriet Martineau writes in her
autobiography that &lsquo;his editorial correspondence with me
was unquestionably the reason, and in great measure the cause, of
the greatest intellectual progress I ever made before the age of
thirty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it was not from William Johnson Fox that at that time came
to our small village the grain of light that was to leaven the
lump around.&nbsp; Lecturing and oratory, and even public
tea-meetings, were things almost unknown.&nbsp; Now and then a
deputation from the London Missionary Society came to Wrentham,
and in this way I remember William Ellis, then a missionary from
Madagascar, and Mr. George Bennett, who, in conjunction with the
Rev. Mr. Tyerman, had been on a tour of <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>inspection to
the islands of the South Seas, and to whose tales of travel
rustic audiences listened with delight.&nbsp; Once upon a
time&mdash;but that was later&mdash;the Religious Tract Society
sent a deputation in the shape of a well-known travelling
secretary, Mr. Jones.&nbsp; This Mr. Jones was inclined to
corpulency, and I can well remember how we all laughed when, on
one occasion, the daughter of a neighbouring minister, having
opened the door in reply to his knock, ran delightedly into her
papa&rsquo;s study to announce the arrival of the Tract
Society!</p>
<p>A great impression was also made in all parts of the country
by the occasional appearances of the Anti-Slavery Society&rsquo;s
lecturers.&nbsp; In 1831, as Sir G. Stephen tells us, the younger
section of the Anti-Slavery body resolved to stir up the country
by sending lecturers to the villages and towns of the
country.&nbsp; The M.P.&rsquo;s did not much like it.&nbsp; The
idea was novel to them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Trust to Parliament,&rsquo;
said they; the outsiders replied, &lsquo;Trust to the
people.&rsquo;&nbsp; This scheme of agitation, however, was
rejected, and would have fallen to the ground had not a
benevolent Quaker of the name of Cropper come forward.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Friend S., what money dost thou want?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want &pound;20,000, but I will <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>begin if I
can get one.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then, I will give thee
&pound;500.&rsquo;&nbsp; Joseph Sturge immediately followed with
a promise of &pound;250, and Mr. Wilberforce twenty guineas; and
&pound;1,000 was raised, and competent agents sent out.&nbsp; It
proved by no means an easy matter to obtain these lecturers, for
their duty was not confined to lecturing; they had also to revive
drooping anti-slavery societies and to establish new ones.&nbsp;
Also they were to have collections at the end of every
lecture.&nbsp; One of them who came to Wrentham was Captain
Pilkington.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pilkington,&rsquo; writes Sir George
Stephen, &lsquo;was a pleasing lecturer, and won over many by his
amiable manners; but he wanted power, and resigned in six
months.&rsquo;&nbsp; We in Wrentham, however, did not think so,
and I can to this day recall the sensation he created in our
rustic minds as he described the horrors of slavery, and showed
us the whip and chains by which those horrors were caused.&nbsp;
To the Dissenting chapel most of these lecturers were indebted
for their audience, and if I ever worked hard as a boy, it was to
get signatures to anti-slavery petitions.&nbsp; Naturally, a
Church parson came to regard all that was attacked by Reformers
as a bulwark of the Establishment, and in our part the
Meetingers&rsquo; were the sole friends of the slave.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>As was to be expected, the reading of the village was of
the most limited description.&nbsp; It is true we children jumped
for joy as once a month came the carrier&rsquo;s cart from
Beccles, with the books for the club&mdash;the <i>Evangelical
Magazine</i>, for all the principal families of the congregation,
and the <i>Penny Magazine</i> and <i>Chambers&rsquo;s
Journal</i>&mdash;then but in their infancy&mdash;for ourselves;
but, apart from that, there was no reading worth
mentioning.&nbsp; That which most astonishes the tourist in
Ireland is the way in which people read the newspapers.&nbsp; In
our Suffolk village the very reverse was the case, partly because
there were few newspapers to read, partly because there were few
to read them, and partly because they were dear to buy.&nbsp; The
one paper which we took in was the <i>Suffolk Chronicle</i>,
which made its appearance on Saturday morning, the price of which
was sixpence, and which was edited by a sturdy Radical of the
name of King, who to the last held to the belief that to have a
London letter full of literary or critical talk for the Suffolk
farmers was, not to put too fine a point on it, to throw pearls
before swine.&nbsp; And perhaps he was right.&nbsp; I can well
remember, when one of my early poetical contributions appeared in
its columns, how a fear was expressed to me by a farmer&rsquo;s
widow in <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>our parish, lest &lsquo;it had cost
me a lot o&rsquo; money&rsquo; to have that effort of my muse in
print.&nbsp; Mr. Childs, of Bungay, had many experiences, equally
rustic and still more illustrative of the simplicity of the
class.&nbsp; Once upon a time one of them came in a great state
of excitement for a copy of the &lsquo;Life of Mr. General
Gazetteer.&rsquo;&nbsp; On another occasion a farmer&rsquo;s wife
came in search of a Testament.&nbsp; She wanted it directly, and
she wanted it of a large type.&nbsp; A specimen was selected,
which met with the worthy woman&rsquo;s approval.&nbsp; But the
question was, could she have it in half an hour, as she would be
away for that time shopping in the town, and would call for it on
her return.&nbsp; She was told that she could, and great was her
astonishment when, on calling on her return for the Testament,
there it was, printed in the particular type she had selected,
ready for her use.</p>
<p>I have a very strong idea that the calm of the country and the
peaceful occupations of the people had not a very rousing
influence upon the intellect.&nbsp; I may go further, and say
that the cares of the farm, when high farming was unknown, did
not much lift at that time the master above the man.&nbsp; The
latter wore a smock-frock, while the former, perhaps, sported a
blue coat with brass buttons, and had rather a better kind of
head-dress, and <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>ambled along on a little steady cob,
that knew at which ale-house to call for the regular allowance,
quite as well as his master.&nbsp; But as regards
talk&mdash;which was chiefly of bullocks and pigs&mdash;well,
there really was no very great difference after all.&nbsp; To
such religion was the mainspring which kept the whole intellect
going; and religion was to be had at the meeting.&nbsp; And I can
well remember how strange it seemed to me that these rough,
simple, untutored sons of the soil could speak of it with
enthusiasm, and could pray, at any rate, with astonishing
fervour.&nbsp; Away from the influence of the meeting-house there
existed a B&oelig;otian state of mind, only to be excited by
appeals to the senses of the most palpable character, a state of
mind in which faith&mdash;the evidence of things not seen,
according to Paul&mdash;was quite out of the question; and I
regret to say that, notwithstanding the activity of the last
fifty years and the praiseworthy and laborious efforts of the
East Anglian clergy in all quarters, suitably to rouse and feed
the intellect of the East Anglian peasantry, a good deal yet
remains to be done.&nbsp; Only a year or two ago, riding on an
omnibus in a Suffolk village, the driver asked me if people could
go to America by land.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; was my
reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you ask such a <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>question?&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, it came out that he had
&lsquo;heerd tell how people got to Americay in ten days; and he
did not see how they could do that unless they went by land, and
had good hosses to get &rsquo;em there at that time.&rsquo;&nbsp;
On my explaining the real state of affairs, he admitted, by way
of apology, that he was not much of a traveller himself.&nbsp;
Once he had been to Colchester; but that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>But to return to the <i>Suffolk Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; It was my
duty as a lad, when it had been duly studied at home, to take it
to the next subscriber, and I fancy by the time the paper had
gone its round it was not a little the worse for wear.&nbsp; But
there were other political impulses which tended to create and
feed the sacred flame of civil and religious liberty.&nbsp; In
one corner of the village lived a small shopkeeper, who stored
away, among his pots and pans of treacle and sugar and grocery, a
few well-thumbed copies, done up in dirty brown paper, of the
squibs and caricatures published by Hone, whom I can just
remember, a red-faced old gentleman in black, in the
<i>Patriot</i> office, and George Cruikshank, with whom I was to
spend many a merry hour in after-life.&nbsp; This small
shopkeeper was one of the chapel people&mdash;a kind of
superintendent in the Sunday-school, for which office he <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>was by no means fitted, but there was no one else to
take the berth, and as the family also dealt with him in many
ways, I had often to repair to his shop.&nbsp; It was then our
young eyes were opened as to the wickedness in high places by the
perusal of the &lsquo;Political House that Jack built,&rsquo; and
other publications of a similar revolutionary character.&nbsp;
Nothing is sacred to the caricaturist, and half a century ago
bishops and statesmen and lords and kings were very fair subjects
for the exercise of his art.&nbsp; In our day things have changed
for the better, partly as the result of the Radical efforts, of
which respectability at that time stood so much in awe.&nbsp;
London newspapers rarely reached so far as Wrentham.&nbsp; It was
the fashion then to look to Ipswich for light and leading.&nbsp;
However, as the cry for reform increased in strength, and the
debates inside the House of Commons and out waxed fiercer, now
and then even a London newspaper found its way into our house,
and I can well remember how our hearts glowed within us as some
one of us read, while father smoked his usual after-dinner pipe,
previous to going out to spend the afternoon visiting his sick
and afflicted; and how such names as Earl Grey, and Lord John
Russell, and Lord Brougham&mdash;the people then called him <!--
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Harry Brougham; it was a pity that he was ever anything
else&mdash;were familiar in our mouths as household words.</p>
<p>In another way also there came to the children in Wrentham the
growing perception of a larger world than that in which we lived,
and moved, and had our being.&nbsp; One of the historic sites of
East Anglia is Framlingham, a small market town, lying a little
off the highroad to London, a few miles from what always seemed
to me the very uninteresting village of Needham Market, though at
one time Godwin, the author of &lsquo;Caleb Williams,&rsquo;
preached in the chapel there.&nbsp; There is now a public school
for Suffolk boys at Framlingham, and it may yet make a noise in
the world.&nbsp; Framlingham in our time has given London Mr.
Jeaffreson, a successful man of letters, and Sir Henry Thompson,
a still more successful surgeon.&nbsp; In my young days it was
chiefly noted for its castle.&nbsp; The mother of that amiable
and excellent lady, Mrs. Trimmer, also came from Framlingham; and
it is to be hoped that the old town may have had something to do
with the formation of the character of a woman whom now we should
sneer at, perhaps, as goody-goody, but who, when George the Third
was King, did much for the education and improvement <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>of
the young.&nbsp; I read in Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s life &lsquo;that
her father was a man of an excellent understanding, and of great
piety; and so high was his reputation for knowledge of divinity,
and so exemplary his moral conduct, that, as an exception to
their general rule, which admitted no laymen, he was chosen
member of a clerical club in the town (Ipswich) in which he
resided.&nbsp; From him,&rsquo; continues the biographer of the
daughter, &lsquo;she imbibed the purest sentiments of religion
and virtue, and learnt betimes the fundamental principles of
Christianity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, it is hoped Mr. Kirby did his
best for his daughter; but, after all, how much more potent is
the influence of a mother!&nbsp; And hence I may claim for
Framlingham a fair share in the formation of even so burning and
shining a light as Mrs. Trimmer.</p>
<p>The name Framlingham, say the learned, or did say&mdash;for
what learned men say at one time does not always correspond with
what they say at another&mdash;is composed of two Saxon words,
signifying the habitation of strangers; and to strangers the
place is still rich in interest.&nbsp; In its church sleeps the
unfortunate, but heroic, Earl of Surrey, whose harmonious verse
still delights the students of English literature.&nbsp; Some say
he was born at <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Framlingham.&nbsp; This is matter of
doubt; but there is no doubt about the fact that he was buried
there by his son, the Earl of Northampton, who erected a handsome
monument to his father&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; The monument is an
elevated tomb, with the Earl&rsquo;s arms and those of his lady
in the front in the angles, and with an inscription in the
centre.&nbsp; It has his effigy in armour, with an ermined
mantle, his feet leaning against a lion couchant.&nbsp; On his
left is his lady in black, with an ermined mantle and a
coronet.&nbsp; Both have their hands held up as in prayer.&nbsp;
On a projecting plinth in front is the figure of his second son,
the Earl of Northampton, in armour, with a mantle of ermine,
kneeling in prayer.&nbsp; Behind, in a similar plinth, kneeling
with a coronet, and in robes, is his eldest daughter, Jane,
Countess of Westmoreland, on the right; and his third daughter
Catherine, the wife of Lord Henry Berkeley on the left.&nbsp; The
monument is kept in order, and painted occasionally, as directed
by the Earl of Northampton, out of the endowment of his hospital
at Greenwich.&nbsp; In repairing the monument in October, 1835,
the Rev. George Attwood, curate of Framlingham, discovered the
remains of the Earl lying embedded in clay, directly under his
figure on his tomb.&nbsp; It is <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>difficult
now to find what high treason the chivalrous and poetic and
gallant Earl had been guilty of; but at that time our eighth
Henry ruled the land, and if he wished anyone out of the way, he
had not far to go for witnesses or judge or jury ready to do his
wicked and wanton will.&nbsp; To the shame of England be it said,
the Earl of Surrey was beheaded when he was only thirty years of
age.&nbsp; No particulars are preserved of his deportment in
prison or on the scaffold, but from the noble spirit he evinced
at his trial, and from his general character, it cannot be
doubted that he behaved in the last scene of his existence with
fortitude and dignity.&nbsp; On the barbarous injustice to which
he was sacrificed comment is unnecessary; but regret at his early
fate is increased by the circumstance that Henry was in
extremities when he ordered his execution, and that his swollen
and enfeebled hands were unequal to the task of signing his
death-warrant.&nbsp; In this respect more fortunate was the
father of Surrey, the Duke of Norfolk, who is buried near the
altar of the church at Framlingham.&nbsp; He also was condemned
to death, but in the meanwhile the King died, and his victim was
set free.&nbsp; Not far off is the tomb of Henry Fitzroy, a
natural son of King Henry.&nbsp; He <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>was a
friend of Surrey, and was to have married his sister.&nbsp; The
other monuments which adorn the interior of this magnificent
church are a table of black marble, supported by angels, to the
memory of Sir Robert Hitcham, a mural monument by Roubillac, and
others to commemorate virtues and graces, as embodied in the
lives of decent men and women in whom the world has long ceased
to take any interest.</p>
<p>The venerable castle&mdash;here I quote Dr. Dugdale&rsquo;s
&lsquo;British Traveller&rsquo;&mdash;with its eventful history,
imparts the strongest interest to the town of Framlingham.&nbsp;
Tradition refers its origin to the sixth century, and ascribes it
to Redwald, one of the early Saxon monarchs.&nbsp; St. Edmund the
Martyr fled hither in 870, and was besieged by the Danes, who
took Framlingham and held it fifty years.&nbsp; The Norman King
gave the castle to the Bigods.&nbsp; The castle passed through
many hands.&nbsp; It was there Queen Mary took shelter when,
after the death of Edward VI., Lady Jane Grey was called to the
throne, and thence she came to London, on the capture of the
former, to take possession of the crown.&nbsp; It was an evil day
for England when she came to Framlingham Castle and beguiled the
hearts of the Suffolk men.&nbsp; Old <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Fox tells
us that when Mary had returned to her castle at Framlingham there
resorted to her &lsquo;the Suffolke men, who, being alwayes
forward in promoting the proceedings of the Gospel, promised her
their aid and help, so that she would not attempt the alteration
of the religion which her brother, King Edward, had before
established by laws and orders publickly enacted, and received by
the consent of the whole realm in his behalf.&nbsp; She
afterwards agreed with such promise made unto them that no
innovation should be made of religion, as that no man would or
could then have misdoubted her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Victorious by the
aid of the Suffolke men,&rdquo; Queen Mary soon forgot her
promise.&nbsp; They of course remonstrated.&nbsp; It was,
methinks,&rsquo; adds Fox, &lsquo;an heavie word that she
answered to the Suffolke men afterwards which did make
supplication unto her grace to performe her promise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For so much,&rdquo; saith she, &ldquo;as you being but
members desire to rule your head, you shall one day perceive the
members must obey their head, and not look to rule over the
same.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, Queen Mary was as good as her
word.&nbsp; As Fox adds, &lsquo;What she performed on her part
the thing itself and the whole story of the persecution doth
testifie.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the stubborn Suffolk gospellers were
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>not to be put down, and a remnant had been left in
Framlingham, as well as in other parts of the country.&nbsp; At
Framlingham we find a Richard Goltie, son-in-law of Samuel Ward,
of Ipswich, was instituted to the rectory in 1630.&nbsp; In 1650
he refused the engagement to submit to the then existing
Government, and was removed, when Henry Sampson, M.A., a fellow
of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, was appointed by his college to the
vacancy.&nbsp; He continued there till the Restoration, when Mr.
Goltie returned and took possession of the living, which he
continued to hold till his death.&nbsp; Not being satisfied to
conform, Mr. Sampson continued awhile preaching at Framlingham to
those who were attached to his ministry, in private houses and
other buildings, and by his labours laid the foundation of the
Congregational or Independent Church in that town, as appears
from a note in the Church Book belonging to the Dissenters
meeting at Woodbridge, in the Quay Lane.&nbsp; Mr. Sampson
collected materials for a history of Nonconformity, a great part
of which is incorporated in Calamy and Palmer&rsquo;s
works.&nbsp; It was to him that John Fairfax, of Needham Market,
wrote, when he and some other ministers were shut up in Bury Gaol
for the crime of preaching the Gospel.&nbsp; <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>It appears
that they had met in the parish church, at Walsham-le-Willows,
where, after the liturgy was read by the clergyman of the parish,
a sermon was preached by a non-licensed minister.&nbsp; The party
were then taken and committed to prison, where they remained till
the next Quarter Sessions, when they were released upon their
recognisances to appear at the next Assizes.&nbsp; Then, it
seems, though not convicted upon any other offence, upon the
suggestion of the justices, to whom they were strangers, they
were committed again to prison, on the plea that <i>they were
persons dangerous to the public peace</i>.&nbsp; Thus were
Dissenters treated in the good old times.&nbsp; Mr. Sampson seems
to have fared somewhat better.&nbsp; After his removal, he
travelled on the Continent, returned to London, entered himself
at the College of Physicians, and lived and died in good
repute.&nbsp; The old congregation having become Unitarian, a new
one was formed, and of this Church a pillar was Mr. Henry
Thompson&mdash;a gentleman well known and widely honoured in his
day.&nbsp; This Mr. Thompson had a son, who was sent to Wrentham
to be educated for awhile with myself.&nbsp; An uncle of his, one
of the most amiable of men, lived at Southwold, close by, and I
presume it was by his means that the settlement was <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>effected.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the change was a
welcome one, as it gave me a pleasant companion for nearly five
years of boyish life.&nbsp; I confess my two sisters&mdash;one of
whom has, alas! long been in her grave&mdash;did all they could
in the way of sports and pastimes to meet my wants and wishes,
and act like boys; but the fact is, though it may be doubted in
these days of Women&rsquo;s Rights, girls are not boys, nor can
they be expected to behave as such.</p>
<p>I confess the advent of this young Thompson from Framlingham
was a great event in our small family circle.&nbsp; In the first
place he came from a town, and that at once gave him a marked
superiority.&nbsp; Then his father kept a horse and gig, for it
was thus young Thompson came to Wrentham, and all the world over
a gig has been a symbol of the respectability dear to the British
heart; and he had been for that time and as an only son carefully
and intelligently trained by one of the family who, in the person
of the late Edward Miall, founder of the <i>Nonconformist</i>,
and M.P. for Bradford, was supposed to be the incarnation of what
was termed the dissidence of Dissent.&nbsp; Young Thompson was
also what would be called a genteel youth, and gave me ideas as
to wearing straps to my trousers, oiling my hair, and generally
adorning <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>my person, which had never entered
into my unsophisticated head.&nbsp; He also had been to London,
and as Framlingham was some twenty miles nearer the
Metropolis&mdash;the centre of intelligence&mdash;than Wrentham,
the intelligence of a Framlingham lad was of course expected,
<i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, to be of a stronger character than that
of one born twenty miles farther from the sun of London.&nbsp;
There was also a good deal of talent in the family on the
mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Mrs. Thompson was a Miss Medley, and
Mr. Medley was an artist of great merit, the son of Mr. Medley,
of Liverpool, a leading Baptist minister in his day, and a writer
of hymns still sung in Baptist churches.&nbsp; Mr. Medley was
also active as a Liberal, and was credited by us boys with a
personal acquaintance with no less illustrious an individual than
the great Brougham himself.&nbsp; Once or twice he came to lodge
during the summer at Southwold; naturally he was visited there by
his grandson, who would return well primed with political
anecdote to our rustic circle, and was deemed by me more of an
authority than ever.&nbsp; Once or twice, too, I had the honour
of being a visitor, and heard Mr. Medley, a fine old gentleman,
who lived to a very advanced age, talk of art and artists and
other matters quite out of <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>my usual
sphere.&nbsp; It is not surprising, then, that the grandson
became in time quite an artist himself, though he is better known
to the world, not so much in that capacity, but as Sir Henry
Thompson, certainly not the least distinguished surgeon of our
day.&nbsp; In Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s last novel,
&lsquo;Endymion,&rsquo; we have a passing reference to one
Wrentham lad, Sir Charles Wetherell, as &lsquo;the eccentric and
too uncompromising Wetherell.&rsquo;&nbsp; Assuredly the fame of
another lad, Sir Henry Thompson, connected with Wrentham, will
longer live.</p>
<p>This reference to Sir Henry Thompson reminds me of his early
attempts at rhyme, which I trust he will forgive me for rescuing
from oblivion.&nbsp; Once upon a time we captured a young cuckoo,
and having carefully gorged it with bread-and-milk, and left it
in a nest in an outhouse, which we devoted mainly to rabbits, the
next morning the poor bird was found to be dead.&nbsp; A prize
was offered for the best couplet.&nbsp; Three of us
contended.&nbsp; My sister wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This lonely sepulchre contains<br />
A little cuckoo&rsquo;s dead remains.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To our grief, cuckoo sweet<br />
Is lying underneath our feet.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Thompson took quite a different and, read by the light
of his subsequent career, a far more characteristic view of the
case.&nbsp; He took care, as a medical man, to dwell on the cause
which had terminated the career of so interesting a bird.&nbsp;
According to him,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It had a breast as soft as silk,<br />
And died of eating bread-and-milk.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuredly in this case the child was father to the man.</p>
<p>But the great awakening of the time, that which made the dry
bones live, and fluttered the dove-cotes of Toryism&mdash;we
never heard the word Conservative then&mdash;was the General
Election.&nbsp; At that time we were always having General
Elections.&nbsp; We had one, of course, when George IV. died and
King William reigned in his stead; we had another when the Duke
was out and the Whigs came in; and then we had another when the
cry ran through the land, and reached even the most remote
villages of East Anglia, of &lsquo;The Bill, the whole Bill, and
nothing but the Bill!&rsquo;&nbsp; Voters were brought down, or
up, as the case might be, from all quarters of the land.&nbsp;
Coaches-full came tearing along, gorgeous with election flags,
and placarded all over with names of rival candidates.&nbsp; <!--
page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Gentlemen of ancient lineage called to request of the
meanest elector the favour of his vote and influence.&nbsp; It
was with pain the Liberals of our little village resolved to vote
against our Benacre neighbour, Sir Thomas Gooch, who had long
represented the county, but of whom the Radicals spoke derisively
as Gaffer Gooch, or the Benacre Bull, and chose in his stead a
country squire known as Robert Newton Shaw, utterly unknown in
our quarter of the county.</p>
<p>It was rather a trying time for the Wrentham Liberals and
Dissenters to do their duty, for Sir Thomas was a neighbour, and
always was a pleasant gentleman in the parish, and had power to
do anyone mischief who went against him.&nbsp; Our medical man
did not vote at all.&nbsp; Our squire actually, I believe,
supported Sir Thomas, and altogether respectable people found
themselves in an extremely awkward position.&nbsp; At Southwold
the people were a little more independent, for Gaffer Gooch
rarely illuminated that little town with his presence; and as my
father, with the economy which is part and parcel of the
Scotchman as he leaves his native land, but which rarely extends
to his children, had, by teaching gentlemen&rsquo;s sons and
other ways, been able to save a <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>little,
which little had been devoted to the purchase of cottage property
in Southwold (well do I remember the difficulty there was in
collecting the rents; never, assuredly, were people so much
afflicted or so unfortunate when the time of payment came), it
was for Southwold that he claimed his vote.&nbsp; I, as the son,
was permitted to share in the glories of that eventful day.&nbsp;
The election took place at school-time, and my companion was
Henry Thompson.&nbsp; We had to walk betimes to Frostenden, where
Farmer Downing lived, who was that <i>rara avis</i> a Liberal
tenant farmer; but of course he did not vote tenant farmer, but
as a freeholder.&nbsp; It was with alarm that Mrs. Downing saw
her lord and master drive off with us two lads in the gig.&nbsp;
There had been riots at London, riots as near as Ipswich, and why
not at Halesworth?&nbsp; A mile or two after we had started we
met, per arrangement, the Southwold contingent, who joined us
with flags flying and a band playing, and all the pride and pomp
and circumstance of war.&nbsp; We rode in a gig, and our animal
was a steady-going mare, and behaved as such; but all had not
gigs or steady-going mares.&nbsp; Some were in carts, some were
on horseback, some in ancient vehicles furbished up for the
occasion; <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>and as the band played and the
people shouted, some of the animals felt induced to dance, and
especially was this restlessness on the part of the quadrupeds
increased as we neared Halesworth, in the market-place of which
was the polling-booth, and in the streets of which we out-lying
voters riding in procession made quite a show.&nbsp; Halesworth,
or Holser, as it was called, was distant about nine miles, lying
to the left of Yoxford, a village which its admirers were wont to
call the Garden of Suffolk.&nbsp; In 1809 the Bishop of Norwich
wrote from Halesworth: &lsquo;The church in this place is
uncommonly fine, and the ruins of an old castle (formerly the
seat of the Howards) are striking and majestic.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
when we went there the ruins were gone&mdash;the more is the
pity&mdash;and the church remained, at that time held by no less
a Liberal than Richard Whately, afterwards Archbishop of
Dublin.&nbsp; I used at times to meet with a country
gentleman&mdash;a brother of a noble lord&mdash;who after he had
spent a fortune merrily, as country gentlemen did in the good old
times, came to live on a small annuity, and, in spite of his
enormous daily consumption of London porter at the leading inn of
the town, managed to reach a good old age.&nbsp; The hon.
gentleman and I were on <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>friendly
terms, and sometimes he would talk of Whately, who had often been
at his house.&nbsp; But, alas! he remembered nothing of a man who
became so celebrated in his day except that he would eat after
dinner any number of oranges, and was so fond of active exercise
that he would take a pitchfork and fill his tumbrels with manure,
or work just like a labourer on a farm.&nbsp; Of the
Doctor&rsquo;s aversion to church-bell ringing we have a curious
illustration in a letter which appeared in the <i>Suffolk
Chronicle</i> in 1825: &lsquo;A short time since a wedding took
place in the families of two of the oldest and most respectable
inhabitants of the town, when it was understood that the Rector
had, for the first time since his induction to his living, given
permission for the bells to greet the happy pair.&nbsp; After,
however, sounding a merry peal a short hour and a half, a message
was received at the belfry that the Rector thought they had rung
long enough.&nbsp; The tardiness with which this mandate was
obeyed soon brought the rev. gentleman in person to enforce his
order, which was then reluctantly complied with to the great
disappointment of the inhabitants, and mortification of the
ringers, several of whom had come from a considerable distance to
assist in the festivities of the day.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>The Independent chapel was an old-fashioned
meeting-house, full of heavy pillars, which, as they intercepted
the view of the preacher, were favourable to that gentle sleep so
peculiarly refreshing on a Sunday afternoon&mdash;especially in
hot weather&mdash;in the square and commodious family pew.&nbsp;
The minister was an old and venerable-looking divine of the name
of Dennant, who was always writing little poems&mdash;I remember
the opening lines of one,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A while ago when I was nought,<br />
And neither body, soul, nor thought&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and whose &lsquo;Soul Prosperity,&rsquo; a volume of sober
prose, reached a second edition.&nbsp; His grandson, Mr. J. R.
Robinson, now the energetic manager of the <i>Daily News</i>, may
be said to have achieved a position in the world of London of
which his simple-hearted and deeply-devotional grandfather could
never have dreamed.&nbsp; As I was the son of a brother minister,
Mr. Dennant&rsquo;s house was open to myself and Thompson, though
we did not go there on the particular day of which I write.&nbsp;
The leading tradesman of the town was a Liberal, and had at least
one pretty daughter, and there we went.&nbsp; Most of the day,
however, we mixed with the mob which crowded round, while the
voters&mdash;<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>you may be sure, not all of them
sober&mdash;were brought up to vote.&nbsp; The excitement was
immense; there was the hourly publication of the state of the
poll&mdash;more or less unreliable, but, nevertheless, exciting;
and what a tumult there was as one or other of the rival
candidates drove up to his temporary quarters in a carriage and
pair, or carriage and four, made a short speech, which was
cheered by his friends and howled at derisively by his foes,
while the horses were being changed, and then drove off at a
gallop to make the same display and to undergo the same ordeal
elsewhere!&nbsp; To be sure, there was a little rough play; now
and then a rush was made by nobody in particular, and for no
particular reason; or, again, an indiscreet voter&mdash;rendered
additionally so by indulgence in beer&mdash;gave occasion for
offence; but really, beyond a scrimmage, a hat broken, a coat or
two torn or bespattered with mud, a cockade rudely snatched from
the wearer, little harm was done.&nbsp; The voters knew each
other, and had come to vote, and had stayed to see the fun.&nbsp;
For the timid, the infirm, the old, the day was a trying one; but
there was an excitement and a life about the affair one misses
now that the ballot has come into play, and has made the voter
less of a man than ever.&nbsp; Of course <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the shops
were shut up.&nbsp; All who could afford to do so kept open
house, and at every available window were the bright, beaming
faces of the Suffolk fair&mdash;oh, they were jolly, those
election days of old!&nbsp; Well, in East Anglia, as elsewhere,
spite of the parsons, spite of the landlords, spite of the
slavery of old custom, spite of old traditions, the freeholders
voted Reform, and Reform was won, and everyone believed that the
kingdom of heaven was at hand.&nbsp; In ten years, I heard people
say, there would be no tithes for the farmer to pay, and welcome
was the announcement; for then, as now, the agricultural interest
was depressed, and the farmer was a ruined man.&nbsp; Now one
takes but a languid interest in the word Reform, but then it
stirred the hearts of the people; and how they celebrated their
victory, how they hoisted flags and got up processions and made
speeches, and feasted and hurrahed, &rsquo;twere tedious to
tell.&nbsp; All over the land the people rejoiced with exceeding
joy.&nbsp; Old things, they believed, had passed away&mdash;all
things had become new.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Bungay Nonconformity&mdash;Hannah
More&mdash;The Childses&mdash;The Queen&rsquo;s
Librarian&mdash;Prince Albert.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the present century, a disgraceful attack
on Methodism&mdash;by which the writer means Dissent in all its
branches&mdash;appeared in what was then the leading critical
journal of the age, the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
sources,&rsquo; said the writer, a clergyman (to his shame be it
recorded) of the Church of England&mdash;no less distinguished a
divine than the far-famed Sydney Smith&mdash;&lsquo;from which we
shall derive our extracts are the Evangelical and Methodistical
magazines for the year 1807, works which are said to be
circulated to the amount of 18,000 or 20,000 every month, and
which contain the sentiments of Arminian and Calvinistic
Methodists, and of the Evangelical clergymen of the Church of
England.&nbsp; We shall use the general term of Methodism to
designate these three <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>classes of fanatics, not troubling
ourselves to point out the finer shades and nicer discriminations
of lunacy, but treating them as all in one general conspiracy
against common-sense and rational orthodox
Christianity.&rsquo;&nbsp; To East Anglia came the reputed worthy
Canon for an illustration of what he termed their policy to have
a great change of ministers.&nbsp; Accordingly, he reprints from
the <i>Evangelical Magazine</i> the following notice of an East
Anglian Nonconformist ordination, which, by-the-bye, in no degree
affects the charge unjustly laid at the door of these
&lsquo;fanatics,&rsquo; as engaged &lsquo;in one general
conspiracy against common-sense and rational orthodox
Christianity.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Same day the Rev. W. Haward,
from Hoxton Academy, was ordained over the Independent Church at
Rendham, Suffolk; Mr. Pickles, of Walpole, began with prayer and
reading; Mr. Price, of Woodbridge, delivered the introductory
discourse, and asked the questions; Mr. Dennant, of Halesworth,
offered the ordinary prayer; <i>Mr. Shufflebottom</i> [the
italics are the Canon&rsquo;s], of Bungay, gave the charge from
Acts xx. 28; Mr. Vincent, of Deal, the general prayer; and Mr.
Walford, of Yarmouth, preached to the people from Phil. ii.
16.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a lad, I saw a good deal of Bungay, though I
never knew the Shufflebottom <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>whose name
seems to have been such a stumbling-block and cause of offence to
the Reverend Canon of St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I say Reverend
Canon of St. Paul&rsquo;s, because, though the writer had not
gained that honour when the review appeared, it was as Canon he
returned to the charge when he sanctioned the republication of it
in his collected works.&nbsp; It was at Bungay that I had my
first painful experience of the utter depravity of the human
heart&mdash;a truth of which, perhaps, for a boy, I learned too
much from the pulpit.&nbsp; The river Waveney runs through
Bungay, and one day, fishing there, I lent a redcoat&mdash;with
whom, like most boys, I was proud to scrape an
acquaintance&mdash;my line, he promising to return it when I came
back from dinner.&nbsp; When I did so, alas! the red-coat was
gone.</p>
<p>Nonconformity in Bungay seems to have originated in the days
of the Lord Protector, in the person of Zephaniah Smith, who was
the author of: (1) &lsquo;The Dome of Heretiques; or, a discovery
of subtle Foxes who were tyed tayle to tayle, and crept into the
Church to do mischief&rsquo;; (2) &lsquo;The Malignant&rsquo;s
Plot; or, the Conspiracie of the Wicked against the Just, laid
open in a sermon preached at Eyke, in Suffolk, January 23,
1697.&nbsp; Preached and published to set forth the grounds <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>why the Wicked lay such crimes to the charge of
God&rsquo;s people as they are cleare off&rsquo;; (3) &lsquo;The
Skillful Teacher.&rsquo;&nbsp; Beloe says of this Smith that
&lsquo;he was a most singular character, and among the first
founders of the sect of the Antinomians.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of the
first leaders of this sect is said by Wood to have been John
Eaton, who was a minister and preacher at Wickham Market, in
which situation and capacity Smith succeeded him.&nbsp; This
Smith published many other tracts and sermons, chiefly fanatical
and with fantastical titles.&nbsp; One is described by Wood, and
is called &lsquo;Directions for Seekers and Expectants, or a
Guide for Weak Christians in these discontented
times.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not give an extract from these
sermons,&rsquo; writes Beloe, who is clearly, like Wood, by no
means a sympathetic or appreciative critic, &lsquo;though very
curious, but they are not characterized by any peculiarity of
diction, and are chiefly remarkable for the enthusiasm with which
the doctrine of the sect to which the preacher belonged is
asserted and vindicated.&nbsp; The hearers also must have been
endowed with an extraordinary degree of patience, as they are
spun out to a great length.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Smith&rsquo;s
ministry at Bungay led to a contention, which resulted in an
appeal to the young Protector, Richard Cromwell.&nbsp; <!-- page
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Then we find Mr. Samuel Malbon silenced by the Act of
Uniformity, who is described as a man mighty in the Scriptures,
who became pastor to the church in Amsterdam.&nbsp; In 1695 we
hear of a conventicle in Bungay, with a preacher with a regularly
paid stipend of &pound;40 a year.&nbsp; Till 1700 the
congregation worshipped in a barn; but in that year the old
meeting-house was built, and let to the congregation at &pound;10
per annum.&nbsp; In 1729 it was made over to the Presbyterians or
Independents worshipping there, &lsquo;for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
founders of that conventicle seem to have suffered for their
faith; yet the glorious Revolution of 1688 had been achieved, and
William of Orange&mdash;who had come from a land which had nobly
sheltered the earlier Nonconformists&mdash;was seated on the
throne.</p>
<p>Bungay, till Sydney Smith made it famous, was not much known
to the general public.&nbsp; It was on the borders of the county
and out of the way.&nbsp; The only coach that ran through it, I
can remember, was a small one that ran from Norwich through
Beccles and Bungay to Yarmouth; and, if I remember aright, on
alternate days.&nbsp; There was, at any rate, no direct
communication between it and London.&nbsp; Bungay is a well-built
market town, skirted on the east and west by the navigable river
Waveney, <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>which divides it from Norfolk, and
was at one time noted for the manufacture of knitted worsted
stockings and Suffolk hempen cloth; but those trades are now
obsolete.&nbsp; The great Roger Bigod&mdash;one of the men who
really did come over with the Conqueror&mdash;built its castle,
the ruins of which yet remain, on a bold eminence on the river
Waveney.&nbsp; &lsquo;The castle,&rsquo; writes Dugdale,
&lsquo;once the residence and stronghold of the Bigods, and by
one of them conceived to be impregnable, has become the
habitation of helpless poverty, many miserable hovels having been
reared against its walls for the accommodation of the lowest
class.&rsquo;&nbsp; The form of the castle appears to have been
octangular.&nbsp; The ruins of two round fortal towers and
fortresses of the west and south-west angles are still standing,
as also three sides of the great tower or keep, the walls of
which are from 7 to 11 feet thick and from 15 to 17 feet
high.&nbsp; In the midst of the ruins, on what is called the
Terrace, is a mineral spring, now disused, and near it is a
vault, or dungeon, of considerable depth.&nbsp; Detached portions
of the wall and their foundations are spread in all directions in
the castle grounds, a ridge of which, about 40 yards long, forms
the southern boundary of a bowling-green which commands
delightful prospects.&nbsp; <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>The mounds
of earth raised for the defence of the castle still retain much
of their original character, though considerably reduced in
height.&nbsp; One of them, facing the south, was partly removed
in 1840, with the intention of forming a cattle market.&nbsp; As
a boy I often heard of the proud boast of Hugh Bigod, second
Earl, one of King Stephen&rsquo;s most formidable opponents, as
recorded by Camden:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Were I in my castle of Bungay,<br />
Upon the river Waveney,<br />
I would not care for the King of Cockeney.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ancient times the Waveney was a much broader stream than it
is now, and Bungay was called <i>Le Bon Eye</i>, or the good
island, then being nearly surrounded by water.&nbsp; Hence the
name, in the vulgar dialect, of Bungay.&nbsp; To &lsquo;go to
Bungay to get a new bottom&rsquo; was a common saying in
Suffolk.</p>
<p>In 1777 we find Hannah More writing to Garrick from Bungay,
which she describes as &lsquo;a much better town than I expected,
very clean and pleasant.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You are the
favourite bard of Bungay&rsquo;&mdash;at that time the tragedians
of the city of Norwich were staying
there&mdash;&lsquo;and,&rsquo; writes Hannah, who at that time
had not become serious and renounced the gaieties of the great
world, &lsquo;the <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>dramatic furore rages terribly among
the people, the more so, I presume, from being allowed to vent
itself so seldom.&nbsp; Everybody goes to the play every
night,&mdash;that is, every other night, which is as often as
they perform.&nbsp; Visiting, drinking, and even card-playing, is
for this happy month suspended; nay, I question if, like Lent, it
does not stop the celebration of weddings, for I do not believe
there is a damsel in the town who would spare the time to be
married during this rarely-occurring scene of festivity.&nbsp; It
must be confessed, however, the good folks have no bad
taste.&rsquo;&nbsp; It must be recollected that Hannah More in
reality belongs to East Anglia.&nbsp; She was the daughter of
Jacob More, who was descended from a respectable family at
Harleston.&nbsp; He was a High Churchman, but all his family were
Nonconformists.&nbsp; His mother used to tell young people that
they would have known how to value Gospel privileges had they
lived like her, when at midnight pious worshippers went with
stealthy steps through the snow to hear the words of inspiration
delivered by a holy man at her father&rsquo;s house; while her
father, with a drawn sword, guarded the entrance from violent or
profane intrusion, adding that they boarded the minister and kept
his horse for &pound;10 a year.&nbsp; An unfortunate <!-- page
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>lawsuit deprived the Mores of their property, and thus
it was that the celebrated Hannah was born at Gloucestershire,
and not in Suffolk or Norfolk.&nbsp; The family mansion was at
Wenhaston, not very far from Wrentham.</p>
<p>In my young days Bungay owed all its fame and most of its
wealth to the far-famed John Childs, who was one of our first
Church Rate martyrs, to whom is due mainly the destruction of the
Bible-printing monopoly, and to whom the late Edward Miall was
much indebted for establishing the <i>Nonconformist</i>
newspaper.&nbsp; For many years it was the habit of Mr. Childs to
celebrate that event by a dinner, at which the wine was good and
the talk was better.&nbsp; Old John Childs, of Bungay, had a
cellar of port which a dean might have envied; and many was the
bottle that I cracked with him as a young man, after a walk from
Wrentham to Bungay, a distance of fourteen miles, to talk with
him on things in general, and politics in particular.&nbsp; He
was emphatically a self-made man&mdash;a man who would have made
his way anywhere, and a man who had a large acquaintance with the
reformers of his day in all parts of the country.&nbsp; On one
occasion the great Dan O&rsquo;Connell came to pay him a visit,
much to the delight of the Suffolk Radicals, <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>and to the
horror of the Tories.&nbsp; The first great dinner at which I had
the honour of being present, and to which I was taken by my
father, who was a great friend of Mr. Childs, was on the occasion
of the presentation to the latter of a testimonial by a
deputation of distinguished Dissenters from Ipswich in connection
with his incarceration in the county gaol at Ipswich, for having
refused to pay rates for the support of a Church in which he did
not believe, and for the performance of a service in which he
took no part.&nbsp; At that time &lsquo;the dear old Church of
England,&rsquo; while it was compelled to tolerate Dissent,
insisted on Dissent being taxed to the uttermost farthing; and
that it does not do so now, and that it is more popular in
consequence, is due to the firm stand taken by such men as John
Childs of Bungay.&nbsp; He was a great phrenologist.&nbsp; In his
garden he had a summer-house, which he facetiously termed his
scullery, where he had some three hundred plaster casts, many of
which he had taken himself of public individuals and friends and
acquaintances.&nbsp; My father was honoured in this way, as also
my eldest sister.&nbsp; Sir Henry Thompson and I escaped that
honour, but I have not forgotten his dark, piercing glance at our
heads, when, as boys, we first came into his presence, and how I
<!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>trusted that the verdict was satisfactory.&nbsp; Of
course the Childses went to Meeting, but when I knew Bungay Mr.
Shufflebottom had been gathered to his fathers, and the Rev. John
Blaikie, a Scotchman, and therefore always a welcome guest at
Wrentham, reigned in his stead.&nbsp; Mr. Childs had a large and
promising family, few of whom now remain.&nbsp; His daughter was
an exceptionally gifted and glorious creature, as in that early
day it seemed to me.&nbsp; She also died early, leaving but one
son, Mr. Crisp, a partner in the well-known legal firm of Messrs.
Ashurst, Morris, and Crisp.&nbsp; It was in the little box by the
window of the London Coffee House&mdash;now, alas! no
more&mdash;where Mr. Childs, on the occasion of his frequent
visits to London, always gathered around him his friends, that I
first made the acquaintance of Mr. Ashurst, the head of the
firm&mdash;a self-made man, like Mr. Childs, of wonderful
acuteness and great public spirit.&nbsp; In religion Mr. Ashurst
was far more advanced than the Bungay printer.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
not a thing to reason about,&rsquo; said the latter; and so to
the last he remained orthodox, attended the Bungay Meeting-house,
invited the divines of that order to his house, put in appearance
at ordination services, and openings of chapels, and was to be
seen at May <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Meetings when in town, where
occasionally his criticisms were of a freer order than is usually
met with at such places.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Bungay Press,&rsquo; wrote a correspondent of the
<i>Bookseller</i>, on the death of Mr. Charles Childs, who had
succeeded his father in the business, &lsquo;has been long known
for its careful and excellent work.&nbsp; Established some short
time before the commencement of the present century, its founder
had, for twenty years, limited its productions to serial
publications and books of a popular and useful character, and in
the year 1823, soon after Mr. John Childs had taken control of
the business, upwards of twenty wooden presses were working, at
long hours, to supply the rapidly-increasing demand for such
works as folio Bibles, universal histories, domestic medicine
books, and other publications then issuing in one and two
shilling numbers from the press.&rsquo;&nbsp; Originally Mr.
Childs had been in a grocer&rsquo;s shop at Norwich.&nbsp; There
he was met with by a Mr. Brightley, a printer and publisher, who,
originally a schoolmaster at Beccles, had suggested to young
Childs that he had better come and help him at Bungay than waste
his time behind a counter.&nbsp; Fortunately for them both the
young man acceded to the proposal, and travelled all over <!--
page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>England driving tandem, and doing everywhere what we
should now call a roaring trade.&nbsp; Then he married Mr.
Brightley&rsquo;s daughter, and became a partner in the firm,
which was known as that of John and R. Childs, and, latterly of
Childs and Son.&nbsp; &lsquo;Uncle Robert,&rsquo; as I used to
hear him called, was little known out of the Bungay circle.&nbsp;
He had a nice house, and lived comfortably, marrying, after a
long courtship, the only one of the Stricklands who was not a
writer.&nbsp; Agnes was often a visitor at Bungay, and not a
little shocked at the atrocious after-dinner talk of the Bungay
Radicals.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you not think,&rsquo; said she, in her
somewhat stilted and tragic style of talk, one day, to a literary
man who was seated next her, author of a French dictionary which
the Childses were printing at the time&mdash;&lsquo;Do you not
think it was a cruel and wicked act to murder the sainted and
unfortunate Charles I.?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; stuttered the author, while the dinner-party
were silent, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have p-p-poisoned him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The gifted authoress talked no more that day.&nbsp; Naturally, as
a lad, seeing so much of Bungay, I wished to be a printer, but
Mr. Childs said there was no use in being a printer without
plenty of capital, and so that idea was renounced.</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>But to return to Mr. John Childs.&nbsp; About the year
1826, in association with the late Joseph Ogle Robinson, he
projected and commenced the publication of a series of books
known in the trade as the &lsquo;Imperial Edition of Standard
Authors,&rsquo; which for many years maintained an extensive
sale, and certainly then met an admitted literary want,
furnishing the student and critical reader, in a cheap and
handsome form, with dictionaries, histories, commentaries,
biographies, and miscellaneous literature of acknowledged value
and importance, such as Burke&rsquo;s works, Gibbon&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Decline and Fall,&rsquo; Howe&rsquo;s works, the writings
of Lord Bacon&mdash;books which are still in the market, and
which, if I may speak from a pretty wide acquaintance with
students&rsquo; libraries fifty years ago, were in great demand
at that time.&nbsp; The disadvantage of such a series is that the
books are too big to put in the pocket or to hold in the
hand.&nbsp; But I do not know that that is a great disadvantage
to a real student who takes up a book to master its contents, and
not merely to pass away his time.&nbsp; To study properly a man
must be in his study.&nbsp; In that particular apartment he is
bound to have a table, and if you place a book on a table to
read, it matters little the size of the page, or the number <!--
page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>of columns each page contains.&nbsp; Mr. Childs set the
fashion of reprinting standard authors on a good-sized page, with
a couple of columns on each page.&nbsp; That fashion was followed
by Mr. W. Smith&mdash;a Fleet Street publisher, than whom a
better man never lived&mdash;and by Messrs. Chambers; but now it
seems quite to have passed away.&nbsp; On the failure of Mr.
Robinson, Mr. Childs&rsquo; valuable reprints were placed in the
hands of Westley and Davis, and subsequently with Ball, Arnold,
and Co.; and latterly, I think, the late Mr. H. G. Bohn reissued
them at intervals.&nbsp; As to his part publications, when Mr.
Childs had given up pushing them, he disposed of them all to Mr.
Virtue, of Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row, who then secured almost a
monopoly of the part-number trade, and thus made a large
fortune.&nbsp; &lsquo;I love books that come out in
numbers,&rsquo; says Lord Montford in &lsquo;Endymion,&rsquo;
&lsquo;as there is a little suspense, and you cannot deprive
yourself of all interest by glancing at the last part of the last
volume.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so I suppose in the same way there will
always be a part-number trade, though the reapers in the field
are many, and the harvest is not what it was.</p>
<p>Active and fiery in body and soul, Mr. John Childs, at a
somewhat later period, with the <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>sympathy
and advocacy of Mr. Joseph Hume and other members of Parliament,
and aided to a large extent by Lord Brougham, succeeded in
procuring the appointment of a Committee of the House of Commons
to inquire into the existing King&rsquo;s Printers&rsquo; Patent
for printing Bibles and Acts of Parliament, the period for the
renewal of which was near at hand.&nbsp; The principle upon which
the patent was originally granted appeared to be <i>correctness
secured only by protection</i>&mdash;a fallacy which the
voluminous evidence of the Committee most completely
exposed.&nbsp; The late Alderman Besley, a typefounder, and a
great friend of John Childs, as well as Robert Childs, practical
printers, gave conclusive evidence on this head, and the result
was that, although the patent was renewed for thirty years,
instead of sixty as before, the Scriptures were sold to the
public at a greatly reduced price, and the trade in Bibles,
though nominally protected, has ever since been practically
free.</p>
<p>Nor did Mr. Childs&rsquo; labours end here.&nbsp; In Scotland
the right of printing Bibles had been granted exclusively to a
company of private persons, Blaire and Bruce, neither of whom had
any practical knowledge of the art of printing, or took any <!--
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>interest in the different editions of the Bible.&nbsp;
The same men also had the supplying all the public revenue
offices of Government with stationery, by which means they
enjoyed an annual profit of more than &pound;6,000 a year.&nbsp;
When the Government, in an economical mood, ordered them to
relinquish the latter contract, not only were they compensated
for the loss, but were continued in their vested rights as
regards Bible-printing.&nbsp; In Scotland there was no one to
interfere with their rights.&nbsp; In England patents had been
given not only to the firm of Messrs. Strahan, Eyre and
Spottiswoode, but to each of the two Universities of Cambridge
and Oxford.&nbsp; Up to 1821 the Bibles of the English
monopolists came freely into Scotland, but then a prohibition,
supported by decisions in the Court of Sessions and the House of
Lords, was obtained.&nbsp; In 1824 Dr. Adam Thompson, of
Coldstream, and three ministers were summoned to answer for the
high crime and misdemeanour of having, as directors of Bible
societies, delivered copies of an edition of Scriptures which had
been printed in England, but which the Scotch monopolists would
not permit to circulate in Scotland.&nbsp; Bible societies in
Scotland had received, in return for their subscription to the
London society, copies <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>of an
octavo Bible in large type, to which the Scotch patentees had no
corresponding edition, and which was much prized by the
aged.&nbsp; And it was because Dr. Thompson and others helped to
circulate it, as agents of the London Bible Society, that they
were proceeded against.&nbsp; The Scotch Bible, in consequence of
the monopoly, was as badly printed as the English one.&nbsp; In
order to show how monopoly had failed to secure good work, a
gentleman sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury an enormous list
of errors which he had found in the Oxford Nonpareil Bible.&nbsp;
In an old Scotch edition the apostle is made to say, &lsquo;Know
ye not that the righteous shall <i>not</i> inherit the kingdom of
God?&rsquo;&nbsp; In another edition &lsquo;The four beasts of
the Apocalypse&rsquo; are &lsquo;<i>sour</i> beasts.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Dr. Lee, afterwards Principal of Edinburgh University, felt
deeply the injustice done by the monopoly, and the heavy taxation
consequently imposed upon the British and Foreign Bible Society;
but he was a man of the study rather than of the street.&nbsp;
Yet in 1837 the monopoly, powerfully defended as it was by Sir
Robert Inglis, who dreaded cheap editions of the Word of God, as
necessarily incorrect and leading to wickedness and infidelity of
all kinds, fell, and it was to John Childs, of <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Bungay,
that in a great measure the fall was due, while owing to the
repeated labours of Dr. Adam Thompson and others, we got cheaper
Bibles and Testaments on the other side of the Tweed.</p>
<p>If you turn to the life of Dr. Adam Thompson, of Coldstream,
the man who had the most publicly to do with the fall of the
monopoly, there can be no doubt on this head.&nbsp; Though
specially interested in the English patents, Mr. Childs was aware
that the one for Scotland fell, to be renewed sooner by twenty
years, and he kept dunning Joseph Hume on the subject, who,
Radical Reformer, at that time had his hands pretty full.&nbsp;
Mr. Childs had got so far as to have his Committee, and to get
the evidence printed.&nbsp; What was the next step?&nbsp; Dr.
Thompson&rsquo;s biographer shall tell us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Childs had been looking out for a Scottish Dissenting minister of
proved ability, zeal, and influence, who should feel the immense
and urgent importance of the question, and after mastering the
unjust principles and the injurious results of the monopoly,
should testify to these before the Committee, in a weighty and
pointed manner, and effectively bring them also before the
ministers and people of Scotland.&nbsp; He fixed upon Dr.
Thompson, and the letter in which he wrote to the Doctor to
prepare <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>for becoming a witness was the
beginning of a ten years&rsquo; copious correspondence, the first
in a series of many hundreds of very lengthy letters, in which
Mr. Childs, with great shrewdness, sagacity, and vigour, and with
perfect confidence of always being in the right, acted as
universal censor, pronouncing oracularly upon all ecclesiastical
and political men and organs, expressing unqualified contempt for
the House of Lords, and very small satisfaction with the House of
Commons, showing no mercy to Churchmen, and little but asperity
to Dissenters, and denouncing all British journals as base or
blind except the <i>Nonconformist</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Only two of
these letters are published in Dr. Thompson&rsquo;s
biography.&nbsp; I give one, partly because it is interesting,
and partly because it is characteristic.&nbsp; Unfortunately, of
all John Childs&rsquo; letters to myself, written in a fine, bold
hand, exactly reproduced by his son and grandson, so that I could
never tell one from the other, I have preserved none.&nbsp;
Childs thus wrote to Dr. Thompson, July 15th, 1839:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Friend</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will be happy to know that I went into Newgate this
morning with my friend Ashurst, and heard their pardon read to
the Canadians.&nbsp; <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>They were released this afternoon,
and Mr. Parker and Mr. Wixon have been dining with me, and are
gone to a lodging, taken for them by Mr. A., where they may
remain till their departure on Wednesday.&nbsp; I have just sent
to Mr. Tidman to inform him they will worship God and return
thanks in his place to-morrow, if all be well.&nbsp; How
wonderfully God has appeared for these people!&nbsp; My dear
friend, when I first saw them in January all things appeared to
be against them, but all has been overruled for good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the time you left on Monday evening, Lord John was
making known to the House of Commons, in your own words, the plan
proposed by yourself, and adopted by him, to my amazement.&nbsp;
Most heartily do I congratulate you on the termination of the
event, so decidedly honourable to yourself in every way.&nbsp; I
do not expect you will approve of all that I have done, but I
felt it to be my duty to address a letter to the <i>Pilot</i> on
the subject, calling attention to the liberty taken with you, and
the manner in which you were humbugged when in concert with the
London societies, and the absolute triumph of your cause when
conducted with single-handed integrity, intelligence, and
energy.&nbsp; If it shall happen that you do not approve of all I
have <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>said, I am sure you ought, because
without you, and with you, if you had left it to the fellows
here, Scotland&rsquo;s Dissenters would have now appeared the
degraded things which, on the Bible subject, the English
Dissenters have appeared in my eyes for some years past.&nbsp; It
is due to you.&nbsp; I was fairly rejoiced when I saw Lord
John&rsquo;s declaration, because I could see from his answer to
Sir James Graham that he meant the thing should be done.&nbsp;
Scotland ought to have a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving, and
as I said to a friend to whom I wrote in Edinburgh, &ldquo;You
ought to have a monument&mdash;the Thompson
monument.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That, sir,&rdquo; the guide would
say, &ldquo;is erected to honour a man by whose honest energy and
zeal Scotland was freed from the most degrading
tyranny&mdash;that of a monopoly in printing the Word of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tablet should bear that memorable sentence
of yours on the first day of your examination, &ldquo;All
monopolies are bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all monopolies religious
monopolies are the worst, and of all religious monopolies a
monopoly of the Word of God is the most outrageous.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Alas!&nbsp; I have heard nothing of the Thompson monument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a man was John Childs.&nbsp; One more busy <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>in
body and brain I never knew.&nbsp; That he was disposed to be
cynical was natural.&nbsp; Most men who see much of the world,
and who do not wear coloured glasses, are so.&nbsp; Take the
history of the Bible monopoly.&nbsp; The work of its abolition
was commenced by John Childs, of Bungay, carried on and completed
as far as Scotland was concerned by Dr. Adam Thompson, while the
British public in its usual silliness awarded &pound;3,000 to Dr.
Campbell, on the plea&mdash;I quote the words of the late Dr.
Morton Brown, of Cheltenham&mdash;that, &lsquo;God gave the
honour very largely to our friend, Dr. Campbell, to smite this
bloated enemy of God and man full in the forehead.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The bloated enemy, as regards Scotland, was dead before Dr.
Campbell had ever penned a line.&nbsp; As regards England, I
believe it still exists.</p>
<p>It must have been about 1837 that the name of John Childs, of
Bungay, was made specially notorious by reason of his refusal to
pay Church-rates, and when he had the honour of being the first
person imprisoned for their non-payment.&nbsp; He was proceeded
against in the Ecclesiastical Courts, and as his refusal to pay
was solely on conscientious grounds, he did not contest the
matter.&nbsp; The result was, he was sent to Ipswich Gaol for the
non-payment <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>of a rate of 17s. 6d., the animus of
the ecclesiastical authorities being manifested by the
endorsement of the writ, &lsquo;Take no bail.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
the first death-blow to Church-rates.&nbsp; The local excitement
it created was intense and unparalleled.&nbsp; In the House of
Commons Sir William Foulkes presented several petitions from
Norfolk, and Mr. Joseph Hume several from Suffolk, on the
subject.&nbsp; One entire sitting of the House of Commons was
devoted to the Bungay Martyr, as Sir Robert Peel ironically
termed him.&nbsp; The Bungay Martyr had however, right on his
side.&nbsp; It was found that a blot had been hit, and it had to
be removed.</p>
<p>The excitement produced by putting Mr. Childs into gaol was
intense at that time all over the land.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beg to
inform you,&rsquo; wrote a Halesworth Dissenter, Mr. William
Lincoln, to the editor of the <i>Patriot</i>, at that time the
organ of Dissent, &lsquo;that my highly-esteemed and talented
friend, Mr. John Childs, of Bungay, has just passed through this
town, in custody of a sheriff&rsquo;s officer, on his way to our
county gaol, by virtue of an attachment, at the suit of Messrs.
Bobbet and Scott, churchwardens of Bungay, for non-payment of
17s. 6d. demanded of him as a Church-rate, and subsequent refusal
to obey a citation for appearance <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>at the
Bishop&rsquo;s Court.&rsquo;&nbsp; Naturally the writer remarked:
&lsquo;It will soon be seen whether proceedings so well in
harmony with the days of fire and faggot are to be tolerated in
this advanced period of the nineteenth century.&rsquo;&nbsp;
When, in due time, Mr. Childs obtained his release, the event was
celebrated at Bungay in fitting style.&nbsp; I find in a private
diary the following note: &lsquo;This day week was a grand day at
Bungay.&nbsp; I heard there were not less than six or seven
thousand people there to welcome his return, and the request of
the police, that the greatest order might be observed, was fully
acted up to.&nbsp; Miss C. did not enter Bungay with her
father.&nbsp; I suppose when she found so great a multitude of
horsemen, gigs, pedestrians and banners, they thought it better
for the young lady and the younger children to retire to the
close carriages.&nbsp; Mr. C. during his imprisonment had letters
from all parts of the kingdom.&rsquo;&nbsp; I remember the
leading Dissenters came to Bungay with a piece of plate, to
present to Mr. Childs, to commemorate his heroism.&nbsp; A dinner
was given by Mr. Childs in connection with the
presentation.&nbsp; At that dinner, lad as I was, I was permitted
to be present.&nbsp; I had never seen anything so grand or
stately before; and that <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>was my
first interview with John Childs, a dark, restless, eagle-eyed
man, whom I was to know better and love more for many a long
day.&nbsp; I took to Radical writing, and nothing could have
pleased John Childs better.&nbsp; I owed much to his friendship
in after-life.</p>
<p>In 1833 the Church-rate question was originally raised in
Bungay, and many of the Dissenters refused to pay.&nbsp; The
local authorities at once took high ground, and put twelve of the
recusants into the Ecclesiastical Court.&nbsp; They caved in,
leaving to John Childs the honour of martyrdom.&nbsp; At the time
of Mr. Childs&rsquo; imprisonment he had recently suffered from a
severe surgical operation, and it was believed by his friends
impossible that he could survive the infliction of
imprisonment.&nbsp; The Rev. John Browne writes: &lsquo;A
committee very generously formed at Ipswich undertook the
management of his affairs, and when they learned at the end of
eleven days&rsquo; imprisonment that he had undergone a most
severe attack, indicating at least the possibility of sudden
death, they sent a deputation to the Court to pay the sum
demanded.&nbsp; The Court, however, required, as well as the
money, the usual oath of canonical obedience, and this Mr. Childs
refused to give.&nbsp; He was told by <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>his friends
that he would surely die in prison, but his reply was,
&lsquo;That is not my business.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it seems so much
had been made of the matter by the newspapers that Mr. Childs was
released without taking the oath.&nbsp; Charles Childs, the son,
followed in his father&rsquo;s steps.&nbsp; At Bungay the
Churchmen seemed to have determined to make Dissenters as
uncomfortable as possible.&nbsp; Actually five years after they
had thrown the father into prison, the churchwardens proceeded
against the son, having been baffled in repeated attempts to
distrain upon his goods, and cited him into the Ecclesiastical
Court, where it took two and a half years to determine whether
the sum of three shillings and fourpence was due.&nbsp; At the
end of that time the judge decided it was not, and the
churchwardens had to pay Mr. Childs&rsquo; costs as well as their
own, which in the course of time amounted to a very respectable
sum.&nbsp; Charles Childs, who died suddenly a few years since,
and who never seemed to me to have aged a day since I first knew
him, was truly a chip of the old block.&nbsp; He was much in
London, as he printed quite as much as his father for the leading
London publishers.&nbsp; An enlightened patriot, he was in very
many cases successful in resisting the obstacles <!-- page
149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>raised from time to time by party spirit or Church
bigotry.&nbsp; On more than one occasion he conducted a number of
his workmen through an illegally-closed path, and opened it by
the destruction of the fences, repeated appeals to the persistent
obstructions having proved unavailing.&nbsp; He was a man of
scholarly and literary attainments, a clever talker, well able to
hold his own, and during the Corn Law and Currency agitation he
contributed one or more articles on these subjects to the
<i>Westminster Review</i>, then edited by his friend, the late
General Perronet Thompson, a very foremost figure in Radical
circles forty years ago, always trying to get into
Parliament&mdash;rarely succeeding in the attempt.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How can he expect it,&rsquo; said Mr. Cobden to me one
day, &lsquo;when, instead of going to the principal people to
support him, he finds out some small tradesman&mdash;some little
tailor or shoemaker&mdash;to introduce him?&rsquo;&nbsp; Once
upon a time the <i>Times</i> furiously attacked Charles
Childs.&nbsp; His reply, which was able and convincing, was
forwarded, but only procured admission in the shape of an
advertisement, for which Mr. Childs had to pay ten pounds.&nbsp;
The corner of East Anglia of which I write rarely produced two
better men than the Childs, father and son.&nbsp; They are gone,
<!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>but the printing business still survives, though no
longer carried on under the well-known name.&nbsp; By their noble
integrity and public spirit they proved themselves worthy of a
craft to which light and literature and leading owe so
much.&nbsp; It is to such men that England is under lasting
obligations, and one of the indirect benefits of a State Church
is that it gives them a grievance, and a sense of wrong, which
compels them to gird up their energies to act the part of village
Hampdens or guiltless Cromwells.&nbsp; All the manhood in them is
aroused and strengthened as they contend for what they deem right
and just, and against force and falsehood.&nbsp; Poets, we are
told, by one himself a poet,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Are cradled into poetry by wrong;<br />
They learn in suffering what they teach in song.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonconformists have cause especially to rejoice in the bigotry
and persecution to which they have been exposed, since it has led
them by a way they knew not, to become the champions of a broader
creed and a more general right than that of which their fathers
dreamed.&nbsp; It is easy to swim with the stream; it requires a
strong man to swim against it.&nbsp; Two hundred years of such
swimming had made the Bungay Nonconformists strong, and <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>gave to the world two such exceptionally sturdy and
strengthful men as John and Charles Childs.&nbsp; I was proud to
know them as a boy; in advancing years I am prouder still to be
permitted to bear this humble testimony to their honest
worth.&nbsp; It is because Nonconformity has raised up such men
in all parts of the land, that a higher tone has been given to
our public life, that politics mean something more than a
struggle between the ins and the outs, and that
&lsquo;Onward&rsquo; is our battle-cry.</p>
<p>Of the young men more or less coming under the influence of
the Childs&rsquo;s, perhaps one of the most successful was the
late Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward, Librarian to her
Majesty.&nbsp; When I first knew him he was in a bank at
Norwich.&nbsp; Thence he passed to Highbury College, and in due
time, after he had taken his B.A. degree, settled as the
Independent minister at Wortwell, near Harleston, in
Norfolk.&nbsp; There he became connected with John Childs, and,
amidst much hard work, edited for the firm a new edition of
&lsquo;Barclay&rsquo;s Universal English Dictionary.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In 1860, on the death of Mr. Glover, who had for many years
filled the post of Librarian to the Queen at Windsor Castle, Mr.
Woodward&rsquo;s name <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>was mentioned to the Prince, in
reply to inquiries for a competent successor.&nbsp; Acting on the
advice of a friend at head-quarters, Mr. Woodward forwarded to
Prince Albert the same printed testimonials which he had sent in
when he was a candidate for the vacant secretaryship of a large
and popular society, and to those alone he owed his appointment
to the office of Librarian to the Queen.&nbsp; An interview took
place at Windsor Castle, which was highly satisfactory; but
before the appointment was finally made, Mr. Woodward informed
Her Majesty and the Prince that there was one circumstance which
he had omitted to mention, and which might disqualify him for the
post.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray, what is that disqualification?&rsquo;
asked the Prince.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; replied Mr.
Woodward, &lsquo;that I have been educated for, and have actually
conducted the services of an Independent congregation in the
country.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And why should that be thought to
disqualify you?&rsquo; asked the Prince.&nbsp; &lsquo;It does
nothing of the sort.&nbsp; If that is all, we are quite
satisfied, and feel perfectly safe in having you for a
librarian.&rsquo;&nbsp; Am I not justified in saying that at one
time Bungay influences reached far and near?</p>

<p>When David Copperfield, Dickens tells us, first caught sight
of Yarmouth, it seemed to him to look rather spongy and
soppy.&nbsp; As he drew nearer, he remarks, &lsquo;and saw the
whole adjacent prospect, lying like a straight, low line under
the sky, I hinted to Peggotty that a mound or so might have
improved it, and also that if the land had been a little more
separated from the sea, and the town and the tide had not been
quite so much mixed up, like toast-and-water, it would have been
much nicer.&rsquo;&nbsp; He adds: &lsquo;When we got into the
street, which was strange to me, and smelt the fish, and pitch,
and oakum, and tallow, and saw the sailors walking about, and the
carts jingling up and down over the stones, I felt that I had
done so busy a place injustice.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this opinion his
readers who know <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Yarmouth will agree.&nbsp; Brighton
and Hastings and Eastbourne might envy Yarmouth its sandy beach,
where you can lead an amphibious life, watching the
fishing-smacks as they come to shore with cargoes often so heavy
as to be sold for manure; watching the merchant-ships and yachts
that lie securely in the Roads, or the long trail of black smoke
of Scotch or northern steamers far away; watching the gulls ever
skimming the surface of the waves; or the children, as they build
little forts and dwellings in the sand to be rudely swept to
destruction by the advancing tide.&nbsp; In the golden light of
summer, how blue is the sky, how green the sea, how yellow the
sand, how jolly look the men and handsome the women!&nbsp; What
health and healing are in the air, as it comes laden with ozone
from the North Sea!&nbsp; You have the sea in front and on each
side to look at, to walk by, to splash in, to sail on.&nbsp; The
danger is, that you grow too fat, too ruddy, too hearty, too
boisterous.&nbsp; As we all know, Venus was born out of the sea,
and out there on that eastern peninsula, of which Yarmouth is the
pride and ornament, there used to flourish bonny lasses, as if to
show that the connection between the ocean and lovely woman is as
intimate as of yore.&nbsp; Yarmouth and Lowestoft owe a great
<!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>deal to the Great Eastern Railway, which has made them
places of health-resort from all parts of England; and truly the
pleasure-seeker or the holiday-maker may go farther and fare
worse.</p>
<p>I was a proud boy when first I set foot in Yarmouth.&nbsp; How
I came to go there I can scarcely remember, but it is to be
presumed I accompanied my father on one of those grand
occasions&mdash;as far as Nonconformist circles are
concerned&mdash;when the brethren met together for godly comfort
and counsel.&nbsp; It is true Wrentham was in Suffolk, and
Yarmouth was in Norfolk, but the Congregational Churches of that
quarter had always been connected by Christian fellowship and
sympathy, and hence I was taken to Yarmouth&mdash;at that time
far more like a Dutch than an English town&mdash;and wonderful to
me was the Quay, with its fine houses on one side and its long
line of ships on the other&mdash;something like the far-famed
Bompjes of Rotterdam&mdash;and the narrow rows in which the
majority of the labouring classes were accustomed to live.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A row,&rsquo; wrote Charles Dickens, &lsquo;is a long,
narrow lane or alley, quite straight, or as nearly so as may be,
with houses on each side, both of which you can sometimes touch
with the finger-tips of each hand by stretching out your arms to
their full extent.&nbsp; <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Many and
many a picturesque old bit of domestic architecture is to be
hunted up among the rows.&nbsp; In some there is little more than
a blank wall for the double boundary.&nbsp; In others the houses
retreat into busy square courts, where washing and
clear-starching are done, and wonderful nasturtiums and
scarlet-runners are reared from green boxes filled with that
scarce commodity, vegetable mould.&nbsp; Most of these rows are
paved with pebbles from the beach, and to traverse them a
peculiar form of low cart, drawn by a single horse, is
employed.&rsquo;&nbsp; This to me was a great novelty, as with
waggons and carts I was familiar, but not with a Yarmouth
cart&mdash;now, I find, replaced by wheelbarrows.&nbsp; In
Amsterdam, at the present day, you may see many such quaint old
rows.&nbsp; But in Amsterdam you have an evil-smelling air, while
in Yarmouth it is ever fresh and crisp, and redolent, as it were,
of the neighbouring sea.&nbsp; The market-place and the big
church were at the back of this congeries of quays and rows, and
the sea and the old pier were at quite a respectable distance
from the town.&nbsp; I fancy the Yarmouth of the London bathers
has now extended down to the sandy beach, and the rough and rude
old pier has given place to one better adapted to the wants and
requirements of an <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>increasingly well-to-do
community.&nbsp; Far more Dutch than English was the Yarmouth of
half a century ago, I again say.</p>
<p>As to the Yarmouth Independent parson, I shall never forget
him.&nbsp; He was a very big man, with great red cheeks that hung
over his collar like blown bladders, and was always on
stilts.&nbsp; He preached in a big meeting-house, now no more,
the pillars of which intercepted alike the view and the
sound.&nbsp; One winter evening he was holding forth, in his
usual heavy style, to a few good people&mdash;with whom,
evidently, all pleasure was out of the question&mdash;who came
there, as in duty bound, and sat like martyrs all the while, and
all were as grave as the preacher, when a wicked boy rushed in
and, in a hurried manner, called out, &lsquo;Fire!
fire!&rsquo;&nbsp; The effect, I am told, was electrical.&nbsp;
For once the good parson was in a hurry, and moved as quickly and
spoke as rapidly as his fellows; but never had there been so much
excitement in his chapel since he had been its pastor.&nbsp;
Once, I remember, he came to town, and dropped in at the close of
a party rather convivially inclined, in the Old London Coffee
House.&nbsp; As the reverend gentleman advanced to greet his
friends, a London lawyer, with all the impudence of his class,
muttered, <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>in a whisper intended to be heard,
and which was heard, by everyone, &lsquo;Yarmouth
bloater.&rsquo;&nbsp; The good man said nothing, but it was
evident he thought all the more, as the group were more or less
tittering over the fitness of the comparison.&nbsp; The lawyer
who made the remark was also the son of a London minister, and,
therefore, might have been expected to have known better.&nbsp; I
fear the Yarmouth minister never forgave him.&nbsp; Well, it only
served him right, as he had a horrible way of making young people
very uncomfortable.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, Master James,&rsquo; said
he to me on one occasion, when all the brethren had come to dine
at Wrentham, and when I was admitted, in conformity with the
golden maxim in all well-regulated family circles, that little
children were to be seen and not heard (perhaps in our day the
fault is too much in an opposite direction), &lsquo;can you
inform me which is the more proper form of expression&mdash;a
pair of new gloves, or a new pair of gloves?&rsquo;&nbsp; Of
course I gave the wrong answer, as I blushed up to the ears at
finding myself the smallest personage in the room, publicly
appealed to by the biggest.&nbsp; He meant well, I dare
say.&nbsp; His only object was to draw me out; but the question
and the questioner gave me a bad quarter of an hour, and I never
got <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>over the unpleasant sensation of
which he had unconsciously been the originator in my youthful
breast.</p>
<p>At that time Yarmouth people were supposed to be a little
superior.&nbsp; They were well-to-do, and lived in good style,
and, as was to be expected, considering the sanitary advantages
of the situation, were in good health and spirits.&nbsp; They got
a good deal of their intellectual character from Norwich, which
at the time set the fashion in such matters.&nbsp; In 1790 two
societies were established in that city for the private and
amicable discussion of miscellaneous questions.&nbsp; One of
these, the Tusculan, seems to have devoted the attention of its
members exclusively to political topics; while the Speculative,
although it imposed no restrictions on the range of inquiry, was
of a more philosophical character.&nbsp; William Taylor was a
member of both, and it is difficult to say whether he
distinguished himself most by his ingenuity in debate, by the
novelty of the information which he brought to bear on every
point, or by the lively sallies of imagination with which he at
once amused and excited his hearers.&nbsp; The papers read by
himself embraced an infinite variety of subjects, from the theory
of the earth, then unillumined by <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the
disclosures of modern geologists, to the most elaborate and
refined productions of its rational tenants, and he was seldom at
a loss to place on new ground or in a fresh light the matter of
discussion introduced by others.&nbsp; Writers of every tongue,
studied by him with observant curiosity, stored his retentive
memory with materials ready to be applied on every occasion,
moulded by his Promethean talent into the most animated and
alluring forms.&nbsp; As a speaker and converser he was eminently
characterized by a constant flow of brilliant ideas, by a rapid
succession of striking images, and by a never-failing copiousness
of words, often quaint, but always correct.&nbsp; A similar
society was formed at Yarmouth, under the auspices of Dr. Aiken,
at which William Taylor also occasionally attended.&nbsp; The
Rev. Thomas Compton has given the following description of these
visits: &lsquo;We were, moreover, sometimes gratified by the
presence of our literary friends from Norwich.&nbsp; I have there
repeatedly listened to the mild and persuasive eloquence of the
late Dr. Enfield.&nbsp; A gentleman, too, still living, who has
lately added to his literary fame by a biographical work of high
repute (I scarcely need add that I allude to Mr. W. Taylor) would
sometimes instruct us by his <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>various and
profound knowledge, or amuse us with his ingenious
paradoxes.&rsquo;&nbsp; When we recollect how at this time the
poetical puerilities of Bath Easton flourished in the West, we
may claim that Norwich and Yarmouth, if not as favoured by
fashion, had at any rate a claim to intellectual reputation at
least quite equal to that city of the <i>ton</i>.&nbsp; Dr.
Sayers, whose biography William Taylor had written, and whose
&lsquo;Dramatic Sketches of Northern Mythology&rsquo; had created
a great sensation at the time, was of Yarmouth extraction.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Compton writes: &lsquo;In Yarmouth, where I lived
at this time, and where Lord Chedworth was accustomed to pay an
annual visit, there was then a society of gentlemen who met once
a fortnight for the purpose of amicable discussion.&nbsp; Our
members&mdash;alas! how few remain&mdash;were of all parties and
persuasions, and some of them of very distinguished
attainments.&nbsp; A society thus constituted was in those days
as pleasant as it was instructive.&nbsp; The most eager
disputation was never found to endanger the most perfect
goodwill, nor did any bitter feuds arise from this entire freedom
of opinion till the prolific period of the French
Revolution.&nbsp; On this subject our controversies became very
impassioned.&nbsp; The present Sir Astley <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>Cooper,
then a very young man, was accustomed to pass his vacations with
his most excellent father, Dr. Cooper, a name ever to be by me
beloved and revered.&nbsp; It was the amusement of our young
friend to say things of the most irritating nature, I
believe&mdash;like Lady Florence Pemberton in the
novel&mdash;merely to see who would make the ugliest face.&nbsp;
Thus circumstanced, it was not in my philosophy to be the coolest
of the party.&rsquo;&nbsp; We can well imagine the
consequences.&nbsp; There was a row, and the literary society
came to grief.&nbsp; As time went on matters became worse instead
of better, and the town was split up into parties&mdash;Liberal
or the reverse, Church or Dissent, but all of one mind as regards
their views being correct; and as to the weakness or wickedness
of persons who thought otherwise.&nbsp; The evil of this spirit
knew no bounds, and the demoralizing effect it produced was
especially apparent at election times.&nbsp; When Oldfield wrote
his &lsquo;Origin of Parliaments,&rsquo; the town, he tells us,
was under the influence of the Earl of Leicester, and was for
many years represented by some of his Lordship&rsquo;s
family.&nbsp; The right of election was in the burgesses at
large, of whom there were at that time one thousand.&nbsp; The
Reform Bill did little to improve the state of <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>affairs; it
led to greater bribery and corruption and intimidation than ever,
and now, as a Parliamentary borough, Yarmouth has ceased to
exist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sugar,&rsquo; it seems, was the slang term
used for money, and the honest voters were too eager to get
it.&nbsp; Alas! in none of our seaport towns is the standard of
morality very high.&nbsp; Yarmouth, at any rate, is not worse
than Deal.&nbsp; In old days the excitement of a Yarmouth
election much affected our village.&nbsp; It lasted some
days.&nbsp; The out-voters were brought from the uttermost parts
of the earth.&nbsp; As there were no railways, stage-coaches were
hired to bring them down from town; and when they changed horses
at Wrentham, quite a crowd would assemble to look at the flags,
and the free and independents on their way to do their duty,
overflowing with enthusiasm and beer.</p>
<p>Sir Astley Cooper was much connected with Yarmouth in his
young days, when his father was the incumbent of the parish
church.&nbsp; Some of his boyish pranks were peculiar.&nbsp; Here
is one of them: &lsquo;Having taken two pillows from his
mother&rsquo;s bed, he carried them up the spire of Yarmouth
Church, at a time when the wind was blowing from the north-east;
and as soon as he <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>had ascended as high as he could, he
ripped them open, and, shaking out their contents, dispersed them
in the air.&nbsp; The feathers were carried away by the wind, and
fell far and wide over the surface of the market-place, to the
great astonishment of a large number of persons assembled
there.&nbsp; The timid looked upon it phenomenon predictive of
some calamity; the inquisitive formed a thousand conjectures;
while some, curious in natural history, actually accounted for it
by a gale of wind in the north blowing wild-fowl feathers from
the island of St. Paul&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; On another occasion
he got into an old trunk, which the family had agreed to get rid
of as inconvenient in the house.&nbsp; In this case he had to pay
the penalty, when he emerged from the chest in the
carpenter&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; The men, who had complained
terribly of its weight, were not inclined to allow young Astley
to get off free.&nbsp; One of Astley&rsquo;s tricks had, however,
a good motive, as it was intended to cure an old woman of her
besetting sin&mdash;a tendency to take a drop too much.&nbsp; In
order to cure the old woman of this weakness, he dressed himself
as well as he could to represent the sable form of his satanic
majesty.&nbsp; Alas! instead of being surprised, the old lady was
too far-gone for that, and listened with tipsy gravity to the
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>distinguished visitor&rsquo;s discourse.&nbsp; In her
case it was true, as Burns wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Wi&rsquo; tipenny we fear nae evil;<br />
Wi&rsquo; usquebae we&rsquo;ll face the deevil.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of his tricks nearly led to unpleasant consequences.&nbsp;
Whilst out shooting one day, near Yarmouth, he killed an
owl&mdash;a bird familiarly known in Yarmouth by the sobriquet of
&lsquo;Brother Billy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having arrived at home, he
went up into his mother&rsquo;s room, with the bird concealed
behind his coat, and, assuming a countenance full of fear and
sorrow, exclaimed, &lsquo;Mother, mother, I&rsquo;ve shot my
brother Billy!&rsquo; but the alarm and distress instantly
depicted on the distracted countenance of his parent induced him
as quickly as possible to pull the owl from under his coat.&nbsp;
This at once exposed the truth and allayed the apprehensions of
his mother&rsquo;s mind, but the effects of the shock it caused
did not so immediately pass away.&nbsp; Dr. Cooper determined to
punish his son, and he therefore confined him, according to his
usual mode of correction, in his own house.&nbsp; Astley was,
however, but little disposed to remain passive in his
imprisonment, and in the wantonness of his ever-active
disposition amused himself by climbing up the chimney, and having
at length reached the <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>summit, endeavoured, by imitating
the well-known tone of the chimney-sweeper, and calling out as
lustily as he could, &lsquo;Sweep, sweep!&rsquo; to attract the
attention of the people below.&nbsp; Even on his father the
incorrigible lad seems on more than one occasion to have tried
his little game.&nbsp; One day, while the worthy Doctor was
marrying a couple in the church, Master Astley concealed himself
in a turret close by the altar, and, imitating his father&rsquo;s
voice, repeated in a subdued tone the words of the
marriage-service as the ceremony proceeded, to the consternation
of his father, who said that he had never observed an echo in
that place before.&nbsp; Once or twice the lad&rsquo;s life was
in peril, as when his foot slipped on the top of the church, and
he was unpleasantly suspended for some time between the rafters
of the ceiling and the floor of the chancel.&nbsp; On another
occasion he had a narrow escape from drowning.&nbsp; It seems
that on the Yare are little boats out together very slightly, for
the purpose of carrying a man, his gun, and dog over the shallows
of Braydon, in pursuit of the flights of wild-fowl which at
certain seasons haunt these shoals.&nbsp; When the boat is thus
loaded, it only draws two or three inches of water, and is quite
unfit for sea.&nbsp; Young Astley nearly lost his life <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>in
attempting to take one of these boats out to open sea.&nbsp; In
this way young Astley Cooper, from his fearless and enterprising
disposition, soon became a sort of leader of the Yarmouth boys,
and at their head, for a time, seems to have devoted himself to
every kind of amusement within his reach&mdash;riding, boating,
fishing, and not unfrequently sports of a less harmless
character, such as breaking lamps and windows, ringing the church
bells at all hours, disturbing the people by frequent alterations
of the church clock, so that if any mischief were committed it
was sure, says his admiring biographer, to be set down to
him.</p>
<p>The two men who shed most literary fame on the Yarmouth of my
childhood were Dawson Turner and Hudson Gurney, who in this
respect resembled each other, that they were both bankers and
both antiquarians more or less distinguished.&nbsp; Dawson Turner
was a man of middle height and of saturnine aspect, who had the
reputation of being a hard taskmaster to the ladies of his
family, who were quite as intelligent and devoted to literature
as himself.&nbsp; He published a &lsquo;Tour in
Normandy&rsquo;&mdash;at that time scarcely anyone travelled
abroad&mdash;and much other matter, and perhaps as an
autograph-collector was unrivalled.&nbsp; Most of <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>his books, with his notes, more or less valuable, are
now in the British Museum.&nbsp; Sir Charles Lyell, when a young
man, visited the Turner family in 1817, and gives us a very high
idea of them all.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Turner,&rsquo; he says, in a
letter to his father, &lsquo;surprises me as much as ever.&nbsp;
He wrote twenty-two letters last night after he had wished us
&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; It kept him up till two
o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again Sir Charles
writes: &lsquo;What I see going on every hour in this family
makes me ashamed of the most active day I ever spent at
Midhurst.&nbsp; Mrs. Turner has been etching with her daughters
in the parlour every morning at half-past six.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of
Hudson Gurney in his youth we get a flattering portrait in one of
the charming &lsquo;Remains of the Late Mrs. Trench,&rsquo;
edited by her son, Archbishop of Dublin.&nbsp; Writing from
Yarmouth in 1799, she says: &lsquo;I have been detained here
since last Friday, waiting for a fair wind, and my imprisonment
would have been comfortless enough had it not have been for the
attention of Mr. Hudson Gurney, a young man on whom I had no
claims except from a letter of Mr. Sanford&rsquo;s, who, without
knowing him, or having any connection with him, recommended me to
his care, feeling wretched that I should be unprotected in the
first <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>part of my journey.&nbsp; He has
already devoted to me one evening and two mornings, assisted me
in money matters, lent me books, and enlivened my confinement to
a wretched room by his pleasant conversation.&nbsp; Mr. Sanford
having described me as a person travelling about <i>for her
health</i>, he says his old assistant in the Bank fancied I was a
decrepit elderly lady who might safely be consigned to his
youthful partner.&nbsp; His description of his surprise thus
prepared was conceived in a very good strain of flattery.&nbsp;
He is almost two-and-twenty, understands several languages, seems
to delight in books, and to be uncommonly well
informed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Little credit, however, is due to Mr.
Hudson Gurney for his politeness in this case.&nbsp; The lovely
and lively widow&mdash;she had married Colonel St. George at the
age of eighteen, and the marriage only lasted two or three years,
the Colonel dying of consumption&mdash;must have possessed
personal and mental attractions irresistible to a cultivated
young man of twenty-two.&nbsp; Had she been old and ugly, it is
to be feared his business engagements would have prevented the
youthful banker devoting much time to her ladyship&rsquo;s
service.</p>
<p>Yarmouth is intimately connected with literature and the fine
arts.&nbsp; It was off Yarmouth that <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>Robinson
Crusoe was shipwrecked; and the testimony he bears to the
character of the people shows how kindly disposed were the
Yarmouth people of his day.&nbsp; &lsquo;We,&rsquo; he writes,
&lsquo;got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to
Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great
humanity, not only by the magistrates of the town, who assigned
us good quarters, but also by particular merchants and owners of
ships, and had money given us, sufficient to carry us either to
London or back to Hull, as we thought fit.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
from Yarmouth that Wordsworth and Coleridge sailed away to
Germany, then almost a <i>terra incognita</i>.&nbsp; Leman
Blanchard was born at Yarmouth, as well as Sayers, the first, if
not the cleverest, of our English caricaturists.&nbsp; One of the
most brilliant men ever returned to Parliament was Winthrop
Mackworth Praed, M.P. for Yarmouth, whose politics as a boy I
detested as much as in after-years I learned to admire his
genius.&nbsp; One of the most fortunate men of our day, Sir James
Paget, the great surgeon, was a Yarmouth lad, and the See of
Chester was filled by an accomplished divine, also a Yarmouth
lad.&nbsp; Southey, when at Yarmouth, where his brother was a
student for some time, was so much struck with <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>the
uniqueness of the epitaphs in the Yarmouth Church, that he took
the trouble to copy many of them.&nbsp; One was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We put him out to nurse;<br />
Alas! his life he paid,<br />
But judge not; he was overlaid.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And hence it may be inferred that in Yarmouth the custom of
baby-farming has long flourished.&nbsp; Possibly thence it may
have extended itself to London.&nbsp; Amongst the truly great men
who have lived and died in Yarmouth, honourable mention must be
made of Hales, the Norfolk Giant.&nbsp; In times past soldiers
and sailors and royal personages were often to be seen at
Yarmouth.&nbsp; It was at Yarmouth the heroes, returning from
many a distant battle-field, often landed.&nbsp; Nelson on one
occasion&mdash;that is, after the affair of Copenhagen&mdash;when
he landed, at once made his way to the hospital to see his
men.&nbsp; To one of them, who had lost his arm, he said,
&lsquo;There, Jack, you and I are spoiled for
fishermen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A good deal of Puritanism seems to have come into England by
way of Yarmouth.&nbsp; In Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, 300
Flemings settled there, who had fled from Popery and Spain in
their native land.&nbsp; In Norwich the Dutch Church <!-- page
172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>remains to this day.&nbsp; Some of them seem to have
been the friends and teachers of the far-famed, and I believe
unjustly maligned, Robert Browne.&nbsp; In Norfolk the seed fell
upon good soil.&nbsp; While sacerdotalism was more or less being
developed in the State Church, the Norfolk men boldly protested
against Papal abominations, as they deemed them, and swore to
maintain the gospel of Geneva and Knox.&nbsp; One of the men
imprisoned when Bancroft was Archbishop of Canterbury, for
attending a conventicle, was Thomas Ladd, &lsquo;a merchant of
Yarmouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The writ ran: &lsquo;Because that, on the
Sabbath days, after the sermons ended, sojourning in the house of
Mr. Jachler, in Yarmouth, who was late preacher in Yarmouth,
joined with him in repeating the substance and heads of the
sermons that day made in the church, at which Thomas Ladd was
usually present.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1624 the penal laws for
suppressing Separatists were strictly enforced in Yarmouth, and
one of the teachers of a small society of Anabaptists was cast
into prison, and the Bishop of Norwich wrote a letter of thanks
to the bailiffs for their activity in this matter, which is
preserved to this day.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, people still
continued to worship God according to the <!-- page 173--><a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>dictates of
conscience; we find the Earl of Dorset in his reply to the town
of Yarmouth, as to the way in which the town should be governed,
adds: &lsquo;I should want in my care of you if I should not let
you know that his Majesty is not only informed, but incensed
against you for conniving at and tolerating a company of
Brownists among you.&nbsp; I pray you remember there was no seam
in the Saviour&rsquo;s garment.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bridge was the
founder of the Yarmouth Congregational Church, somewhere about
the time of the commencement of the Civil War.&nbsp; The people
declared for the Parliament.&nbsp; Colonel Goffe was one of its
representatives in the House of Commons.&nbsp; All along, the
town seems to have been puritanically inclined, and to have been
in this matter more independent than neighbouring towns.&nbsp; At
one time they were so tolerant that the Independents seem to have
worshipped in one end of the church while the regular clergyman
performed the service in the other; but that did not last long,
and when the Independents had a place of worship of their own,
they were not a little troubled by Friends and Papists claiming
for themselves the liberty the Independents had sought and
won.&nbsp; In 1655 the peace of the Church was disturbed by
Quaker doctrines.&nbsp; It appears two females, members <!-- page
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>of
the Church, had joined them, and refused to return.&nbsp; We
read: &lsquo;The messenger appointed to visit May Rouse, brought
in an account of her disowning and despising the Church; she
would not come at all unless she had a message from the Spirit
moving her.&rsquo;&nbsp; She came, however, a week after
(December 11), but by reason of the cold weather was desired to
come in again the next Tuesday.&nbsp; She did so, and gave in
these two reasons why she forsook the Church: 1.&nbsp; Because
the doctrine of the Gospel of Faith was not holden forth;
2.&nbsp; Because there wanted the right administration of
baptism.</p>
<p>In 1659 the Church at Yarmouth, feeling the times to be full
of trouble and of peril, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;1.&nbsp; We judge a Parliament to be expedient for the
preservation of the peace of these nations; and withal, we do
desire that all due care be taken that the Parliament be such as
may preserve the interests of Christ and His people in these
nations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2.&nbsp; As touching the magistrates&rsquo; power in
matters of faith and worship, we have declared our judgments in
our late (Free Savoy) confession, and though we greatly prize our
Christian liberties, yet we profess our utter dislike and
abhorrence of <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>a universal toleration, as being
contrary to the mind of God in His Word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3.&nbsp; We judge that the taking away of tithes for
the maintenance of ministers until as full a maintenance be
equally secured and as legally settled, tends very much to the
destruction of the ministry, and the preaching of the Gospel in
these nations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4.&nbsp; It is our desire that countenance be not given
unto, nor trust reposed in, the hand of Quakers, they being
persons of such principles as are destructive to the Gospel, and
inconsistent with the peace of modern societies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In five years the Yarmouth people had a Roland for their
Oliver; the King had got his own again, and he and the Parliament
of the day looked upon the Independents or Presbyterians as
mischievous as the Quakers; and as to tithes, they were quite as
much resolved, the only difference being that King and Parliament
insisted on their being paid to Episcopalians alone.&nbsp; In
1770 Lady Huntingdon writes: &lsquo;Success has crowned our
labours in that wicked place, Yarmouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bendish, in whom the Protector was said to have lived
again, was quite a character in Yarmouth society.&nbsp; Bridget
Ireton, the granddaughter <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>of the
Protector, married in 1669 Mr. Thomas Bendish, a descendant of
Sir Thomas Bendish, baronet, Ambassador from Charles I. to the
Sultan.&nbsp; She died in 1728, removing, however, in the latter
years of her life to Yarmouth.&nbsp; Her name stands among the
members of the church in London of which Caryl had been pastor,
and over which Dr. Watts presided.&nbsp; To her the latter
addressed at any rate one copy of verses to be found in his
collected works.&nbsp; She recollected her grandfather, and
standing, when six years old, between his knees at a State
Council, she heard secrets which neither bribes nor whippings
could extract from her.&nbsp; Her grandfather she held to be a
saint in heaven, and only second to the Twelve Apostles.&nbsp;
Asked one day whether she had ever been at Court, her reply was,
&lsquo;I have never been at Court since I was waited upon on the
knee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet she managed to dispense with a good deal
of waiting, and never would suffer a servant to attend her.&nbsp;
God, she said, was a sufficient guard, and she would have no
other.&nbsp; She is described as loquacious and eloquent and
enthusiastic, frequenting the drawing-rooms and assemblies of
Yarmouth, dressed in the richest silks, and with a small black
hood on her head.&nbsp; When she left, which would be at one in
the <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>morning, perched on her
old-fashioned saddle, she would trot home, piercing the night air
with her loud, jubilant psalms, in which she described herself as
one of the elect, in a tone more remarkable for strength than
sweetness.&nbsp; In the daytime she would work with her
labourers, taking her turn at the pitchfork or the spade.&nbsp;
The old Court dresses of her mother and Mrs. Cromwell were
bequeathed by her to Mrs. Robert Luson, of Yarmouth, and were
shown as recently as 1834, at an exhibition of Court dresses held
at the Somerset Gallery in the Strand.&nbsp; As was to be
expected, Mrs. Bendish was enthusiastic in the cause of the
Revolution of 1688, and the printed sheets relating to it were
dropped by her secretly in the streets of Yarmouth, to prepare
the people for the good time coming.&nbsp; Her son was a friend
of Dr. Watts as well as his mother.&nbsp; He died at Yarmouth,
unmarried, in the year 1753, and with him the line of Bendish
seems to have come to an end.&nbsp; Another daughter of Ireton
was married to Nathaniel Carter, who died in 1723, aged 78.&nbsp;
His father, John Carter, was commander-in-chief of the militia of
the town in 1654.&nbsp; He subscribed the Solemn League and
Covenant, being then one of the elders of the Independent
congregation.&nbsp; He was also bailiff of <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>the town,
and an intimate friend of Ireton.&nbsp; He died in 1667.&nbsp; On
his tombstone we read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;His course, his fight, his race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus finished, fought, and run,<br />
Death brings him to the place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From whence is no return.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He lived at No. 4, South Quay, and it was there, so it is
said, that the resolve was made that King Charles should die.</p>
<p>He is gone, but his room still remains unaltered&mdash;a large
wainscoted upper chamber, thirty feet long, with three windows
looking on to the quay, with carved and ornamented chimney-piece
and ceiling.&nbsp; A great obscurity, as was to be expected,
hangs over the transaction, as even now there are men who shrink
from lifting up a finger against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.&nbsp;
Dinner had been ordered at four, but it was not till eleven, that
it was served, and that the die had been cast.&nbsp; The members
of the Secret Council, we are told, &lsquo;after a very short
repast, immediately set off by post&mdash;many for London, and
some for the quarters of the army.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such is the
account given in a letter, written in 1773, by Mr. Mewling Luson,
a well-known resident in Yarmouth, whose father, Mr. William
Luson, was nearly connected the <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>Cromwell
family.&nbsp; Nathaniel Carter, the son-in-law of Ireton, was in
the habit of showing the room, and relating the occurrence
connected with it, which happened when he was a boy.&nbsp;
Cromwell was not at that council.&nbsp; He never was in Yarmouth;
but that there was such consultation there is more than
probable.&nbsp; Yarmouth was full of Cromwellites.&nbsp; In the
Market Place, now known as the Weavers&rsquo; Arms, to this day
is shown the panelled parlour whence Miles Corbet was used to go
forth to worship in that part of the church allotted to the
Independents.&nbsp; Miles Corbet was the son of Sir Thomas
Corbet, of Sprouston, who had been made Recorder of Yarmouth in
the first year of Charles, and who was one of the representatives
of the town in the Long Parliament.&nbsp; The son was an ardent
supporter of the policy of Cromwell, and, like him, laboured that
England might be religious and free and great, as she never could
be under any king of the Stuart race; and he met with his
reward.&nbsp; &lsquo;See, young man,&rsquo; said an old man to
Wilberforce, as he pointed to a figure of Christ on the cross,
&lsquo;see the fate of a Reformer.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was so
emphatically with Miles Corbet.&nbsp; Under the date of 1662
there is the following entry in the church-book:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>&lsquo;1662.&mdash;Miles Corbet
suffered in London.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was a member of the church there, and was one of the judges
who sat on the trial of King Charles I.&nbsp; His name stands
last on the list of those who signed the warrant for that
monarch&rsquo;s execution.&nbsp; Corbet fled into Holland at the
Restoration, with Colonels Okey and Barkstead.&nbsp; George
Downing&mdash;a name ever infamous&mdash;had been Colonel
Okey&rsquo;s chaplain.&nbsp; He became a Royalist at the
Restoration, and was despatched as Envoy Extraordinary into
Holland, where, under a promise of safety, he trepanned the three
persons above named into his power, and sent them over to England
to suffer death for having been members of the Commission for
trying King Charles I.&nbsp; For this service he was created a
baronet.&nbsp; The King sent an order to the Sheriffs of London
on April 21, 1662, that Okey&rsquo;s head and quarters should
have Christian burial, as he had manifested some signs of
contrition; but Barkstead&rsquo;s head was directed to be placed
on the Traitor&rsquo;s Gate in the Tower, and Corbet&rsquo;s head
on the bridge, and their quarters on the City gates.</p>
<p>Foremost amongst the noted women of the Independent Church
must be mentioned Sarah Martin, of whose life a sketch appeared
in the <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span><i>Edinburgh Review</i> as far back
as 1847.&nbsp; A life of her was also published by the Religious
Tract Society.&nbsp; Sarah, who joined the Yarmouth church in
1811, was born at Caistor.&nbsp; From her nineteenth year she
devoted her only day of rest, the Sabbath, to the task of
teaching in a Sunday-school.&nbsp; She likewise visited the
inmates of the workhouse, and read the Scriptures to the aged and
the sick.&nbsp; But the gaol was the scene of her greatest
labours.&nbsp; In 1819, after some difficulty, she obtained
admission to it, and soon seems to have acquired an extraordinary
influence over the minds of the prisoners.&nbsp; She then gave up
one day in the week to instruct them in reading and
writing.&nbsp; At length she attended the prison regularly, and
kept an exact account of her proceedings and their results in a
book, which is now preserved in the public library of the
town.&nbsp; As there was no chaplain, she read and preached to
the inmates herself, and devised means of obtaining employment
for them.&nbsp; She continued this good work till the end of her
days in 1843, when she died, aged fifty-three.&nbsp; A handsome
window of stained glass, costing upwards of &pound;100, raised by
subscription, has been placed to her memory in the west window of
the north aisle of St. Nicholas Church.&nbsp; But <!-- page
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>her fame extends beyond local limits, and is part of
the inheritance of the universal Church.&nbsp; It was in Mr.
Walford&rsquo;s time that Sarah Martin commenced her work.&nbsp;
Mr. Walford tells us, in his Autobiography, that the Church had
somewhat degenerated in his day, that the line of thought was
worldly, and not such as became the Gospel.&nbsp; It is clear
that in his time it greatly revived, and, even as a lad, the
intelligence of the congregation seemed to lift me up into quite
a new sphere, so different were the merchants and ship-owners of
Yarmouth from the rustic inhabitants of my native village.&nbsp;
In this respect, if I remember aright, the family of Shelley were
particularly distinguished.&nbsp; One dear old lady, who lived at
the Quay, was emphatically the minister&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; She
had a nice house of her own and ample means, and there she
welcomed ministers and their wives and children.&nbsp; It is to
be hoped, for the sake of poor parsons, that such people still
live.&nbsp; I know it was a great treat to me to enjoy the
hospitality of the kind-hearted Mrs. Goderham, for whose memory I
still cherish an affectionate regard.&nbsp; To live in one of the
best houses on the Quay, and to lie in my bed and to see through
the windows the masts of the shipping, was indeed to a boy a
treat.</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>A little while ago I chanced to be at Norwich, when the
thought naturally occurred to me that I would take a run to
Yarmouth&mdash;a journey quickly made by the rail.&nbsp; In my
case the journey was safely and expeditiously accomplished, and I
hastened once more to revisit the scenes and associations of my
youth.&nbsp; Alas! wherever I went I found changes.&nbsp; A new
generation had arisen that knew not Joseph.&nbsp; The wind was
howling down the Quay; the sand was blown into my mouth, my nose,
my ears; I could scarcely see for the latter, or walk for the
former; but, nevertheless, I made my way to the pier.&nbsp; Only
one person was on it, and his back was turned to me.&nbsp; As he
stood at the extreme end, with chest expanded, with mouth wide
open, as if prepared to swallow the raging sea in front and the
Dutch coast farther off, I thought I knew the figure.&nbsp; It
was a reporter from Fleet Street and he was the only man to greet
me in the town I once knew so well.&nbsp; Yes; the Yarmouth of my
youth was gone.&nbsp; Then a reporter from Fleet Street was an
individual never dreamt of.&nbsp; And so the world changes, and
we get new men, fresh faces, other minds.&nbsp; The antiquarian
Camden, were he to revisit Yarmouth, would not be a little
astonished at what he would see.&nbsp; He wrote: &lsquo;As <!--
page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>soon as the Yare has passed Claxton, it takes a turn to
the south, that it may descend more gently into the sea, by which
means it makes a sort of little tongue or slip of land, washt on
one side by itself, on the other side by the sea.&nbsp; In this
slip, upon an open shore, I saw Yarmouth, a very neat harbour and
town, fortified both by the nature of the place and the
contrivance of art.&nbsp; For, though it be almost surrounded
with water, on the west with a river, over which there is a
drawbridge, and on either side with the sea, except to the north,
where it is joined to the continent; yet it is fenced with
strong, stately walls, which, with the river, figure it into an
oblong quadrangle.&nbsp; Besides the towers upon these, there is
a mole or mount, to the east, from whence the great guns command
the sea (scarce half a mile distant) all round.&nbsp; It has but
one church, though very large and with a stately high spire,
built near the north gate by Herbert, Bishop of
Norwich.&rsquo;&nbsp; In only one respect the Yarmouth of to-day
resembles that of Camden&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Then the north wind
played the tyrant and plagued the coast, and it does so
still.</p>

<p>Many, many years ago, when wandering in the North of Germany,
I came to an hotel in the Fremden Buch, of which (Englishmen at
that time were far more patriotic and less cosmopolitan than in
these degenerate days) an enthusiastic Englishman had
written&mdash;and possibly the writing had been suggested by the
hard fare and dirty ways of the place:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;England, with all thy faults, I love thee
still.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Underneath, a still more enthusiastic Englishman had written:
&lsquo;Faults?&nbsp; What faults?&nbsp; I know of none, except
that Brigg&rsquo;s Lane, Norwich, wants widening.&rsquo;&nbsp;
For the benefit of the reader who may be a stranger to the
locality, let me inform him that <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Brigg&rsquo;s Lane leads out of the fine Market Place,
for which the good old city of Norwich is celebrated all the
world over, and that on a recent visit to Norwich I found that
the one fault which could be laid at the door of England had been
removed&mdash;that Brigg&rsquo;s Lane had been
widened&mdash;that, in fact, it had ceased to be a lane, and had
been elevated into the dignity of a street.</p>
<p>My first acquaintance with Norwich, when I was a lad of tender
years and of limited experience, was by Brigg&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp;
I had reached it by means of a carrier&rsquo;s cart&mdash;the
only mode of conveyance between Southwold, Wrentham, Beccles and
Norwich&mdash;a carrier&rsquo;s cart with a hood drawn by three
noble horses, and able to accommodate almost any number of
travellers and any amount of luggage.&nbsp; As the driver was
well known to everyone, there was also a good deal of
conversation of a more or less friendly character.&nbsp; The cart
took one day to reach Norwich&mdash;which was, and it may be is,
the commercial emporium of all that district&mdash;and another
day to return.&nbsp; The beauty of such a conveyance, as compared
with the railway travelling of to-day, was that there was no
occasion to be in a flurry if you wanted to travel by it.&nbsp;
Goldsmith&mdash;for such was the proprietor and driver&rsquo;s
name&mdash;when he came to <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>a place was
in no hurry to leave it.&nbsp; All the tradesmen in the village
had hampers or boxes to return, and it took some time to collect
them; or messages and notes to send, and it took some time to
write them; and at the alehouse there was always a little gossip
to be done while the horses enjoyed their pail of water or
mouthful of hay.&nbsp; Even at the worst there was no fear of
being left behind, as by dint of running and holloaing you might
get up with the cart, unless you were very much behind
indeed.&nbsp; But you may be sure that when the day came that I
was to visit the great city of Norwich I was ready for the
carrier&rsquo;s cart long before the carrier&rsquo;s cart was
ready for me.&nbsp; Why was it, you ask, that the Norwich journey
was undertaken?&nbsp; The answer is not difficult to give.&nbsp;
The Reform agitation at that time had quickened the entire
intellectual and social life of the people.&nbsp; At length had
dawned the age of reason, and had come the rights of man.&nbsp;
The victory had been won all along the line, and was to be
celebrated in the most emphatic manner.&nbsp; We Dissenters
rejoiced with exceeding joy; for we looked forward, as a natural
result, to the restoration of that religious equality in the eye
of the law of which we had been unrighteously deprived, <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>and in consequence of which we had suffered in many
ways.&nbsp; We joined, as a matter of course, in the celebration
of the victory which we and the entire body of Reformers
throughout the land had gained; and how could that be done better
than by feeding the entire community on old English fare washed
down by old English ale?&nbsp; And this was done as far as
practicable everywhere.&nbsp; For instance, at Bungay there was a
public feast in the Market Place, and on the town-pump the
Messrs. Childs erected a printing-press, which they kept hard at
work all day printing off papers intended to do honour to the
great event their fellow-townsmen were celebrating in so jovial a
manner.&nbsp; In Norwich the demonstration was to be of a more
imposing character, and as an invitation had come to the heads of
the family from an old friend, a minister out of work, and living
more or less comfortably on his property, it seemed good to them
to accept it, and to take me with them, deeming, possibly, that
of two evils it was best to choose the least, and that I should
be safer under their eye at Norwich than with no one to look
after me at home.&nbsp; At any rate, be that as it may, the
change was not a little welcome, and much did I see to wonder at
in the old Castle, the new Gaol, the size <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>of the
city, the extent of the Market Place, the smartness of the
people, and the glare of the shops.&nbsp; It well repaid me for
the ride of twenty-six miles and the jolting of the
carrier&rsquo;s cart along the dusty roads.</p>
<p>As I look into the mirror of the past, I see, alas! but a
faded picture of that wonderful banquet in Norwich to celebrate
Reform.&nbsp; There was a procession with banners and music,
which seemed to me endless, as it toiled along in the dust under
the fierce sun of summer, the spectators cheering all the
way.&nbsp; There were speeches, I dare say, though no word of
them remains; but I have a distinct recollection of peeping into
the tents or tent, where the diners were at work, and of
receiving from some one or other of them a bit of plum-pudding
prepared for that day, which seemed to me of unusual
excellence.&nbsp; I have a distinct recollection also of the
fireworks in the evening, the first I had ever seen, on the
Castle plain, and of the dense crowd that had turned out to see
the sight; but I can well remember that I enjoyed myself much,
and that I was awfully tired when it was all over.</p>
<p>Another memory also comes to me in connection with the old
Dragon,&mdash;not of Revelation, but of Norwich&mdash;a huge
green monster, which was usually <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>kept in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and dragged out at the time of city
festivities.&nbsp; Men inside of it carried it along the street,
and the sight was terrible to see, as it had a ferocious head and
a villainous tail, and resembled nothing that is in the heaven
above or the earth beneath or the waters under the earth.&nbsp; I
fancy, however, since the schoolmaster has gone abroad, that kind
of dragon has ceased to roar.&nbsp; I think it was at a Norwich
election that I saw it for the first and the only time, and it
followed in the procession formed to chair the Members&mdash;the
Members being seated in gorgeous array on chairs, borne on the
heads of people, and every now and then, much to the delight of
the mob, though I should imagine very little to his own, the
chair, with the Member in it, was tossed up into the air, and by
this means it was supposed the general public were able to get a
view of their M.P. and to see what manner of man he was.&nbsp; It
was in some such way that I, as a lad, realized, as I never else
should have done, the red face and the pink-silk stockings of the
Hon. Mr. Scarlett, the happy candidate who pretended to enjoy the
fun, as with the best grace possible under the circumstances he
smiled on the ladies in the windows of the street, as he was
borne along and bowed to all.&nbsp; From <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>my
recollection of the chairing I saw that time, I am more inclined
to admire the activity of Wilberforce, of whom we read, when
elected for Hull, &lsquo;When the procession reached his
mother&rsquo;s house, he sprang from the chair, and, presenting
himself with surprising quickness at a projecting window&mdash;it
was that of the nursery in which his childhood had been
passed&mdash;he addressed the populace with such complete effect
that he was afterwards able to decide the election of its
successor.&rsquo;&nbsp; At Norwich the Hon. Mr. Scarlett did well
in not attempting a similar display of agility.&nbsp; Perhaps,
however, it is quite as well that we have got rid of the chairing
and the humour&mdash;Heaven help us!&mdash;to which it gave rise
on the part of an English mob.</p>
<p>There was a delightful flavour of antiquity about the Norwich
of that day&mdash;its old fusty chapels and churches, its old
bridges and narrow streets.&nbsp; All the people with whom I came
into contact on that festival seemed to me well stricken in
years.&nbsp; It was not so very long since, old Hornbutton Jack
had been seen threading his way along its ancient streets.&nbsp;
With a countenance much resembling the portraits of Erasmus, with
gray hair hanging about his shoulders, with his hat drawn over
his eyes and his hands behind him, as if in deep meditation; <!--
page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>John Fransham, the Norwich metaphysician and
mathematician, might well excite the curiosity of the casual
observer, especially when I add that he was bandy-legged, that he
was short of stature, that he wore a green jacket, a broad hat,
large shoes, and short worsted stockings.&nbsp; A Norwich weaver
had helped to make Fransham a philosopher.&nbsp; Wright said
Fransham could discourse well on the nature and fitness of
things.&nbsp; He possessed a purely philosophical spirit and a
soul well purified from vulgar errors.&nbsp; Fransham made
himself famous in his day.&nbsp; There is every reason to believe
that he had been for some time tutor to Mr. Windham.&nbsp; He is
once recorded to have spent a day with Dr. Parr.&nbsp; Many of
his pupils became professional men; with one of them, Dr. Leeds,
the reader of Foote&rsquo;s comedies, if such a one exists, may
be acquainted.&nbsp; The tutor and his pupil, as Johnny
Macpherson and Dr. Last, were actually exhibited on the
stage.&nbsp; But to return to Norwich antiquities.&nbsp; I have a
dim memory of some old place where the Dutch and Huguenot
refugees were permitted to meet for worship, and even now I can
recognise there the possibility of another Sir Thomas
Browne&mdash;unless the Norwich of my boyhood has undergone the
destructive process we <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>love to
call improvement&mdash;not even disturbed in his quiet study by
the storm of civil war, inditing his thoughts as follows:
&lsquo;That crystal is nothing else but ice strongly congealed;
that a diamond is softened or broken by the blood of a goat; that
bays preserve from the mischief of lightning and thunder; that
the horse hath no gall; that a kingfisher hanged by the bill
showeth where the wind lay; that the flesh of peacocks corrupteth
not;&rsquo; and so on&mdash;questions, it may be, as pertinent as
those learnedly discussed in half-crown magazines at the present
day.</p>
<p>As a boy, I was chiefly familiar with Norwich crapes and
bombazines and Norwich shawls, which at that time were making
quite a sensation in the fashionable world.&nbsp; It was at a
later time that I came to hear of Old Crome and the Norwich
school.&nbsp; Of him writes Mr. Wedmore, that &lsquo;he died in a
substantial square-built house, in what was a good street then,
in the parish of St. George, Colegate, having begun as a workman,
and ended as a bourgeois.&nbsp; He was a simple man, of genial
company.&nbsp; To the end of his life he used to go of an evening
to the public-house as to an informal club.&nbsp; In the
privileged bar-parlour, behind the taps and glasses, he sat with
his friends and the shopkeepers, <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>talking of
local things.&nbsp; But it is not to be supposed that because his
life was from end to end a humble one, though prosperous even
outwardly after its kind, Crome was deprived of the companionship
most fitted to his genius, the stimulus that he most
needed.&nbsp; The very existence of the Norwich Society of
Artists settles that question.&nbsp; The local men hung on his
words; he knew that he was not only making pictures, but a
school.&nbsp; And in the quietness of a provincial city a coterie
had been formed of men bent on the pursuit of an honest and
homely art, and of these he was the chief.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dying,
his last words were, &lsquo;Hobbema, oh, Hobbema, how I loved
thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; In my young days Mr. John Sell Cotman chiefly
represented Norwich, although in later times he became connected
with King&rsquo;s College, London.&nbsp; A lady writes to me:
&lsquo;I think it was in the summer of 1842 Mr. Cotman came down
to Norwich to visit his son John, who at that time was occupying
a house on St. Bennet&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; He visited us at Thorpe
several times, and was unusually well and in good spirits, with
sketchbook or folio always in hand.&nbsp; His father and sisters,
too, were then living in a small house at Thorpe, and from the
balcony of their house, which looked over the valley of the
Wensum, he made <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>one of his last interesting
sketches, twelve of which, after his death, the following year,
were selected by his sons for publication.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn gives us a pleasant picture of Norwich when he went
there &lsquo;to see that famous scholar and physitian, Dr. T.
Browne, author of the &ldquo;Religio Medici&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Vulgar Errors,&rdquo; etc., now lately
knighted.&rsquo;&nbsp; Evelyn continues: &lsquo;Next morning I
went to see Sir Thomas Browne, with whom I had corresponded by
letter, though I had never seen him before, his whole house and
garden being a Paradise and cabinet of rarities, and that of the
best collection, especially medals, books, plants and natural
things.&nbsp; Amongst other curiosities, Sir Thomas has a
collection of all the eggs of all the foule and birds he could
procure; that country, especially the promonotary of Norfolck,
being frequented, as he said, by severall kinds, which seldom or
never go further into the land, as cranes, storkes, eagles, and a
variety of water-foule.&nbsp; He led me to see all the remarkable
places of this ancient citty, being one of the largest and
certainly, after London, one of the noblest of England, for its
venerable cathedrall, number of stately churches, cleannesse of
the streetes and building of flints so exquisitely headed and
squared, as I was much <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>astonished
at; but he told me they had lost the art of squaring the flints,
in which at one time they so much excelled, and of which the
churches, best houses, and walls are built.&rsquo;&nbsp; Further,
Evelyn tells us: &lsquo;The suburbs are large, the prospect
sweete with other amenities, not omitting the flower-gardens, in
which all the inhabitants excel.&nbsp; The fabric of stuffs
brings a vast trade to this populous towne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Long has Norwich rejoiced in clever people.&nbsp; In the life
of William Taylor, one of her most distinguished sons, we have a
formidable array of illustrious Norwich personages, in whom,
alas! at the present time the world takes no interest.&nbsp; Sir
James Edward Smith, founder and first President of the
Linn&aelig;an Society, ought not to be forgotten.&nbsp; Of Taylor
himself Mackintosh wrote: &lsquo;I can still trace William Taylor
by his Armenian dress, gliding through the crowd in Annual
Reviews, Monthly Magazines, Athen&aelig;ums, etc., rousing the
stupid public by paradox, or correcting it by useful and
seasonable truth.&nbsp; It is true that he does not speak the
Armenian or any other tongue but the Taylorian, but I am so fond
of his vigour and originality, that for his sake I have studied
and learned the language.&nbsp; As the Hebrew is studied by one
book, so is the Taylorian by me for another.&nbsp; <!-- page
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>He
never deigns to write to me, but in print I doubt whether he has
many readers who so much understand, relish, and tolerate him,
for which he ought to reward me by some of his manuscript
esoteries.&rsquo;&nbsp; More may be said of William Taylor.&nbsp;
It was he who made Walter Scott a poet.&nbsp; Taylor&rsquo;s
spirited translation of Burger&rsquo;s &lsquo;Leonore&rsquo; with
the two well-known lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Tramp, tramp along the land they rode,<br
/>
Splash, splash along the sea,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>opened up to Scott a field in which for a time he won fame and
wealth.</p>
<p>Of Mrs. Taylor, wife of the grandson of the eminent Hebraist,
Mackintosh declared that she was the Madame Roland of
Norwich.&nbsp; We owe to her Mrs. Austen and Lady Duff
Gordon.&nbsp; Mr. Reeve, the translator of De Tocqueville&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Democracy,&rsquo; has preserved the memory of his father,
Dr. Henry Reeve, by the republication of his &lsquo;Journal of a
Tour on the Continent.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let me also mention that Dr.
Caius, the founder of Caius College, Cambridge, was a Norwich
man.</p>
<p>To Noncons Norwich offers peculiar attractions.&nbsp; We have
in Dr. Williams&rsquo;s library &lsquo;The Order of the Prophesie
in Norwich&rsquo;; and Robinson, the leader of the Pilgrim
Fathers, had a Norwich <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>charge.&nbsp; Even in a later day some of the Norwich
divines had a godly zeal for freedom, worthy of Milton himself,
and on which the Pilgrim Fathers would have smiled
approval.&nbsp; It is told of Mark Wilks, the brother of Matthew,
and the grandfather of our London Mark Wilks, that when a
deputation went from Norwich during the Thelwall and Horne Tooke
trials, when, if the Castlereagh gang had had their will, there
would have been found a short and easy way with the Dissenters,
and came back on the Sunday morning, entering the place after the
service had commenced, that he called out, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
the news?&rsquo; as he saw them enter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Acquitted,&rsquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank
God!&rsquo; said the parson, as they all joined in singing</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Praise God from whom all blessings
flow.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a fact that Wilks&rsquo;s first sermon in the Countess
of Huntingdon&rsquo;s Chapel at Norwich was from the text,
&lsquo;There is a lad here with five barley loaves and a few
small fishes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let me tell another story, this time
in connection with that Old Meeting which has so much to attract
the visitor at Norwich.&nbsp; It had a grand old man, William
Youngman, amongst its supporters; I see him now, with his
choleric face, his full fat figure, his black knee-breeches and
silk <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>stockings, his gold-headed
cane.&nbsp; He was an author, a learned man, as well as a Norwich
merchant, the very Aristarchus of Dissent&mdash;a kind-hearted,
hospitable man withal, if my boyish experience may be relied
on.&nbsp; One Sunday there came to preach in the Old Meeting a
young man named Halley from London, who lived to be honoured as
few of our Dissenting D.D.&rsquo;s have been.&nbsp; He was young,
and he felt nervous as he looked from the pulpit on the austere
critic in his great square pew just beneath.&nbsp; Well, thought
the young preacher, a sermon on keeping the Sabbath will be safe,
and he selected that for his morning discourse.&nbsp; The service
over, up comes the grand old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;The next time,
young man, you preach, preach on something you understand;&rsquo;
and, having said so, he bought a pennyworth of apples of a woman
in the street, leaving the young man to digest his remarks as
best he could.&nbsp; Again the service was to be carried
on.&nbsp; The young man was in the pulpit, the grand old man
below.&nbsp; There was singing and prayer, but no sermon, the
young man having bolted after opening the service.&nbsp; I like
better the picture of Norwich I get in Sir James
Mackintosh&rsquo;s Life, where Basil Montague tells us how he and
Mackintosh, when travelling the <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Norfolk
circuit, always hastened to Norwich to spend their evenings in
the circle of which Mrs. Taylor was the attraction and the
centre.&nbsp; The wife of a Norwich tradesman, we see her sitting
sewing and talking in the midst of her family, the companion of
philosophers, who compared her to Lucy Hutchinson, and a model
wife.&nbsp; Far away in India Sir James writes to her: &lsquo;I
know the value of your letters.&nbsp; They rouse my mind on
subjects which interest us in common&mdash;friends, children,
literature, and life.&nbsp; Their moral tone cheers and braces
me.&nbsp; I ought to be made permanently happy by contemplating a
mind like yours; which seems more exclusively to derive its
gratifications from its duties than almost any
other.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was in the Norwich Octagon that these
Taylors worshipped.&nbsp; Their Unitarianism seemed to have
affected them more favourably than it did Harriet Martineau,
whose family also attended there.&nbsp; I remember Edward Taylor,
who was the Gresham Professor of Music.&nbsp; But theologically,
I presume, the palm of excellence in connection with the Octagon
is to be awarded to Dr. Taylor, the great Hebrew scholar.&nbsp;
He wrote to old Newton: &lsquo;I have been looking through my
Bible, and can&rsquo;t find your doctrine of the
Atonement.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Last night I <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>could not
see to get into bed,&rsquo; replied old Newton, &lsquo;because I
found I had my extinguisher on the candle.&nbsp; Take off the
extinguisher, and then you will see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leaving theology, let us get up on the gray old castle, which
is to be turned into a museum, and look round on the city lying
at our feet.&nbsp; Would you have a finer view?&nbsp; Cross the
Yare and walk up the new road (made by the unemployed one hard
winter) to Mousehold Heath, and after you have done thinking of
Kitt&rsquo;s rebellion&mdash;an agrarian one, by-the-bye, and
worth thinking about just at this time&mdash;and of the Lollards,
who were burnt just under you, look across to the city in the
valley, with its heights all round, more resembling the Holy
City, so travellers say, than any other city in the world.&nbsp;
In the foreground is the cathedral, right beyond rises the castle
on the hill; church spires, warehouses, public buildings, private
dwellings, manufactories, chimneys&rsquo; smoke, complete the
landscape fringed by the green of the distant hills.&nbsp; There
are a hundred thousand people there&mdash;to be preached to and
saved.</p>
<p>Windham was rather hard on the Norwich of his day.&nbsp; In
his diary, in 1798, he records a visit to Norwich, of which city
he was the representative.&nbsp; <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>On October
9 he dined at the Swan&mdash;&lsquo;dinner, like the sessions
dinner, but ball in the evening distinguished by the presence of
Mrs. Siddons.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the 10th he dined at the
Bishop&rsquo;s&mdash;&lsquo;A party, of, I suppose, fifty,
chiefly clergy.&nbsp; I felt the same enjoyment that I frequently
do at large dinners&mdash;they afford, in general, what never
fails to be pleasant&mdash;solitude in a crowd.&rsquo;&nbsp; On
the 11th he writes: &lsquo;Dined with sheriffs at King&rsquo;s
Head.&nbsp; Robinson, the late sheriff, was there, and much as he
may be below his own opinion of himself, he is more to talk to
than the generality of those who are found on those
occasions.&nbsp; I could not help reflecting on the very low
state of talents or understanding in those who compose the whole,
nearly, of the society of Norwich.&nbsp; The French are surely a
more enlightened and polished people.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps
Windham would have fared better had he dined with some of the
leading Dissenters.&nbsp; Few of the clergy of East Anglia at
that time would have been fitting company for the friend of
Johnson and Burke.&nbsp; In Norwich, Mr. Windham often managed to
make himself unpopular.&nbsp; For instance, towards the end of
the session of 1788, Mr. Windham called the attention of
Government to a requisition from France, which was then suffering
the greatest distress <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>from a scarcity of grain.&nbsp; The
object of this requisition was to be supplied with 20,000 sacks
of flour from this country.&nbsp; So small a boon ought, he
thought, to be granted from motives of humanity; but a Committee
of the House of Commons having decided against it, the Ministers,
though they professed themselves disposed to afford the relief
sought for, could not, after such a decision, undertake to grant
it upon their own responsibility.&nbsp; The leading part which
Mr. Windham took in favour of this requisition occasioned,
amongst some of his constituents at Norwich, considerable
clamour.&nbsp; He allayed the storm by a private letter addressed
to those citizens of Norwich who were most likely to be affected
by a rise in the price of provisions; but the fact that Norwich
should thus have backed up the inhuman policy of refusing food to
France showed how strong at that time was the force of passion,
and how hard it is to break down hereditary animosity.&nbsp; As a
further illustration of manners and habits of the East Anglian
clergy, let me mention that when, in 1778, Windham made the
speech which pointed him out to be a man of marked ability in
connection with the call made on the country for carrying on the
American War, one of the Canons of the cathedral, and a great
supporter <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of the war, exclaimed:
&lsquo;D&mdash;n him!&nbsp; I could cut his tongue
out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In my young days, in serious circles, there was no name dearer
than that of Joseph Gurney&mdash;a fine-looking man with a
musical voice, always ready to aid with money, or in other ways,
all that was right and good, or what seemed to him such.&nbsp; In
the &lsquo;Memorials of a Quaker Lady&rsquo; he is described
thus: &lsquo;He sat on the end seat of the first cross-form, and
both preached and supplicated.&nbsp; I was very much struck with
him.&nbsp; His fine person, his beautiful dark, glossy hair, his
intelligent, benign, and truly amiable countenance, made a deep
impression upon me.&nbsp; And as he noticed me most kindly, as I
was introduced to him by Elizabeth Fry, as the little girl his
sister Priscilla wanted to bring to England, I felt myself
greatly honoured.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Gurneys have an ancient
lineage, and had their home in Gourney, in Upper Normandy.&nbsp;
One of them, of course, fought in the ranks of the winners at the
battle of Hastings.&nbsp; Another was a crusader.&nbsp; Another
had done good service at Acre, as a follower of Richard of the
Lion Heart.&nbsp; When the main line came to an end, one branch
settled in Norfolk.&nbsp; Gurney&rsquo;s Bank at Norwich was one
of the institutions of the city, and was as famous in <!-- page
205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>my
day as at a later time was the great house of Overend and Gurney,
which, when it fell, created a panic in financial circles all the
world over.</p>
<p>At Earlham, the home of the Gurneys, we learn how much may be
done by a family, and how widespread its influence for good or
evil may become.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton certainly stands
foremost, not alone amongst the East Anglians, but the
philanthropists of later years.&nbsp; At the age of sixteen young
Buxton went to Earlham as a guest.&nbsp; His biographer writes:
&lsquo;They received him as one of themselves, early appreciating
his masterly, though still uncultivated mind; while, on his side,
their cordial and encouraging welcome seemed to draw out all his
latent powers.&nbsp; He at once joined with them in reading and
study, and from this visit may be dated a remarkable change in
the whole tone of his character; he received a stimulus not
merely in the acquisition of knowledge, but in the formation of
studious habits and intellectual tastes.&nbsp; Nor could the same
influence fail of extending to the refinement of his disposition
and manners.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that time Norwich&mdash;the Buxtons
being witnesses&mdash;was distinguished for good society, and
Earlham was celebrated for its hospitality.&nbsp; <!-- page
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>Mr. Gurney, the father, belonged to the Society of
Friends, but his family was not brought up with any strict regard
to its peculiarities.&nbsp; He put little restraint on their
domestic amusements, and music and dancing were among their
favourite recreations.&nbsp; The third daughter, Mrs. Fry, had,
indeed, united herself more closely with the Society of Friends;
but her example had not then been followed by any of her brothers
and sisters.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; wrote Sir Thomas, in
later years, &lsquo;no blessing of a temporal nature&mdash;and it
is not only temporal&mdash;for which I ought to render so many
thanks as my connection with the Earlham family.&nbsp; It has
given a colour to my life.&nbsp; Its influence was most positive,
and pregnant with good at that critical period between school and
manhood.&nbsp; They were eager to improve; I caught the
infection.&nbsp; I was resolved to please them, and in the
college at Dublin, at a distance from all my friends and all
control, their influence and the desire to please them kept me
hard at my books, and sweetened the task they gave.&nbsp; The
distinctions I gained at college (little valuable as
distinctions, but valuable because habits of industry,
perseverance and resolution were necessary to attain
them)&mdash;these boyish distinctions were exclusively the result
of the animating <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>passion in my mind to carry back to
them the prizes which they prompted and enabled me to
win.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wilberforce, when he was staying at Lowestoft in 1816, wrote:
&lsquo;I am still full of Earlham and its excellent
inhabitants.&nbsp; One of our great astronomers stated it as
probable there may be stars whose light has been travelling to us
from the Creation, and has not yet reached our little
planet.&nbsp; In the Earlham family a new constellation has
broken in upon us, for which you must invent a name, as you are
fond of star-gazing, and if it indicates a little monstrosity (as
they are apt to give the collection of stars the names of strange
creatures&mdash;dragons, bears, etc.), the various stars of which
the Earlham assemblage is made,&rsquo; continues Wilberforce,
&lsquo;will include also much to be respected and
loved.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that time Mrs. Opie was one of the Norwich
stars.&nbsp; Caroline Fox, who went to dine with her described
her as in great force and really jolly.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is
enthusiastic about Father Mathew, reads Dickens voraciously,
takes to Carlyle, but thinks his appearance rather against
him&mdash;talks much and with great spirit of people, but never
ill-naturedly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Norwich,&rsquo; as described by Camden, &lsquo;on
account of its wealth, populousness, neatness of buildings, <!--
page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>beautiful churches, with the number of them&mdash;for
it has a matter of fifty parishes&mdash;as also the industry of
its citizens, loyalty to their Prince, is to be reckoned among
the most considerable cities in Britain.&nbsp; It was fortified
with walls that have a great many turrets and eleven
gates.&rsquo;&nbsp; Camden, quoting one writer after another,
adds the eulogy of Andrew Johnston, a Scotchman, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A town whose stately piles and happy
seat<br />
Her citizens and strangers both delight;<br />
Whose tedious siege and plunder made her bear<br />
In Norman battles an unhappy share,<br />
And feel the sad effects of dreadful war.<br />
These storms o&rsquo;erblown, now blest with constant peace,<br
/>
She saw her riches and her trade increase.<br />
State here by wealth, by beauty yet undone,<br />
How blest if vain excess be yet unknown!<br />
So fully is she from herself supplied<br />
That England while she stands can never want a head.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Norwich went Robinson to help to build up in Amsterdam
that Church of the Pilgrim Fathers which was to be in its turn
the mother of a great Republic such as the world had never
seen.&nbsp; He has been styled the Father of Modern
Congregationalism; be that as it may, when he bade farewell in
that quaint old harbour, Delfhaven&mdash;which looks as if not a
brick or a building had been touched since&mdash;he was doing a
work from which <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>neither himself nor those who stood
with him could ever have expected such wonderful results.&nbsp;
That emigration to Holland in Wren&rsquo;s time was a great loss
of money and men to England, and was an indication of
Nonconformist strength which wise Churchmen would have
conciliated rather than driven to extremities.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
sooth it was,&rsquo; wrote Heylin, &lsquo;that the people in many
great trading towns which were near the sea, having long been
discharged of the bond of ceremonies, no sooner came to hear the
least noise of a conformity, but they began to spurn against it;
and when they found that all their striving was in vain, that
they had lost the comfort of their lecturers and that their
ministers began to shrink at the very name of a visitation, it
was no hard matter for those ministers and lecturers to persuade
them to remove their dwellings and transport their
trades.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The sun of heaven,&rsquo; say they,
&lsquo;doth shine as comfortably in other places; the Sun of
Righteousness much brighter.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Better to go and
dwell in Goshen, find it where we can, than tarry in the midst of
such an Egyptian darkness as is now falling on the
land.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of the preachers who gave that advice and
acted in accordance with it was William Bridge, M.A.&nbsp;
Against him Wren <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>was so furious that he fled to
Holland and settled down as one of the pastors of the church at
Rotterdam.&nbsp; In 1643 we find him pastor of the church at
Norwich and Yarmouth, and one of the Assembly of Divines.&nbsp;
In 1644 the church was separated&mdash;a part meeting at Yarmouth
and a part at Norwich.&nbsp; This was done on the advice of Mr.
John Phillip, of Wrentham&mdash;a godly minister of great
influence in his denomination in his day.</p>
<p>As was to be expected, I was taken to the Old Meeting House at
Norwich, where many learned men had preached, and where many men
almost as learned listened.&nbsp; The gigantic pews, in which a
small family might have lived, filled me with amazement.&nbsp;
And equally appalling to me was the respectability of the people,
of a very different class from that of our Wrentham chapel.&nbsp;
Close by was the Octagon Chapel, where the Unitarians worshipped,
equally impressive in its respectability.&nbsp; But what struck
me most was the new and fashionable Baptist chapel of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, where the venerable and learned Kinghorn
preached&mdash;a great Hebrew scholar and the champion of strict
communion&mdash;against Robert Hall, and other degenerate
Baptists, who were ready to admit to the Lord&rsquo;s Table any
Christians, whether properly <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>baptized&mdash;that is, by immersion when
adults&mdash;or merely sprinkled as infants.&nbsp; Up to this day
I confound the worthy man with John the Baptist, probably because
he looked so lank and long and lean.&nbsp; He was a man of
singularly precise habits, so much so that I heard of an old lady
who always regulated her cooking by his daily walk, putting the
dumplings into the pot to boil when he went, and taking them out
when he returned.&nbsp; I could write much about him, but <i>cui
bono</i>? who cares about a dead Baptist lion?&nbsp; Not even the
Baptists themselves.&nbsp; On going into their library in Castle
Street the other day, to look at Kinghorn&rsquo;s life, I found
no one had taken the trouble to cut the pages.&nbsp; In the front
gallery of St. Mary&rsquo;s, Mr. Brewer, the Norwich
schoolmaster, had sittings for the boys of his school, including
his own sons, who, at King&rsquo;s College and elsewhere, have
done much to illustrate our national history and
literature.&nbsp; If I remember aright, one of the congregation
was a jolly-looking old gentleman who, as Uncle Jerry, laid the
foundation of a mustard manufactory, which has placed one of the
present M.P.&rsquo;s for Norwich at the head of a business of
unrivalled extent.&nbsp; When Mr. Kinghorn died, his place was
taken by Mr. Brock, better known as Dr. Brock, <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>of
Bloomsbury Chapel, London.&nbsp; Under Mr. Brock&rsquo;s
preaching the reputation of St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel was increased
rather than diminished.&nbsp; As a young man himself at that
time, he was peculiarly attractive to the young, and the singing
was very different from the rustic psalmody of my native village,
in spite of the fact that we had a bass-viol at all times, and on
highly-favoured occasions such an array of flutes and clarionets
as really astonished the natives and delighted me.</p>
<p>But to return to the Old Meeting.&nbsp; Calamy writes of one
of the Norwich ministers, of the name of Cromwell, that &lsquo;he
enjoyed but one peaceable day after his settlement, being on the
second forced out of his meeting-house, the licenses being called
in, and then for nine years together he was never without
trouble.&nbsp; Sometimes he was pursued with indictments at
sessions, at assizes, and then with citations of the
ecclesiastical courts; and at other times feigned letters, rhymes
or libels were dropped in the streets or church and fathered upon
him, so that he was forced to make his house his prison.&nbsp; At
length that was broken open, and he absconded into the houses of
his friends, till he contracted his old disease&rsquo; a second
time.&nbsp; It is said that he was invited on one occasion to
dine with Bishop Reynolds, <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>when
several young clergy were present.&nbsp; When Mr. Cromwell
retired, the Bishop rose and attended him, and then a general
laugh ensued.&nbsp; On his return his lordship rebuked his guests
for their unmannerly conduct, and told them that Mr. Cromwell had
more solid divinity in his little finger than all of them had in
their bodies.&nbsp; It must be remembered that, like most of the
early Independent ministers, Mr. Cromwell had a University
training; and even in my young days the respect shown to a
learned ministry kept up not a little of the high standard which
had been laid down by the fathers and founders of Dissent.&nbsp;
In these more degenerate days it is to be questioned whether as
much can be said.&nbsp; The Old Meeting House at Norwich was
finished as far back as 1643.&nbsp; The only pastor of the church
who was not an author was the Rev. Dr. Scott, who died in
1767.&nbsp; In the Octagon Chapel the preachers had been still
more distinguished.&nbsp; One of them was the Rev. Dr. Taylor,
author of the famous Hebrew Concordance, which was published in
two volumes folio, and was the labour of fourteen years.&nbsp; He
left Norwich to become tutor at the newly-erected Academy at
Warrington; but his son, Mr. Edward Taylor, the Gresham Professor
of Music, was often <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>a visitor at Wrentham, where he had
a little property, which he valued, as it gave him a vote.&nbsp;
Another of the preachers at the Octagon was the Rev. R. Alderson,
who afterwards became Recorder of Norwich.&nbsp; The Mr. Edward
Taylor of whom I have just written was baptized by him.&nbsp; One
day, being under examination as a witness in court, Alderson
questioned him as to his age.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said
Taylor, a little nettled, &lsquo;you ought to know, for you
baptized me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I baptized you!&rsquo; exclaimed
Alderson.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Recorder never liked to be reminded of his having been a
preacher.&nbsp; The Marchioness of Salisbury is of this
family.&nbsp; Perhaps, of these Unitarian preachers, one of the
most distinguished was Dr. William Enfield, whose
&lsquo;Speaker&rsquo; was one of the books placed in the hands of
ingenuous youth, and whose &lsquo;History of Philosophy&rsquo;
was one of the works to be studied in their riper years.&nbsp;
Norwich, indeed, was full of learned men.&nbsp; Its aged Bishop,
Bathurst, was the one voter for Reform, much to the delight of
William IV., who said that he was a fine fellow, and deserved to
be the helmsman of the Church in the rough sea she would soon
have to steer through.&nbsp; His one offence in the eyes of
George III. was that he voted against the King&mdash;that is, in
favour <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>of justice to the Catholics.&nbsp;
With such a Bishop a Reformer, no wonder that all Norwich went
wild with joy when the battle of Reform was fought and won.&nbsp;
Bishop Stanley, who succeeded, was also in his way a great
Liberal, and invited Jenny Lind to stay with him at the
palace.&nbsp; I often used to see him at Exeter Hall, where his
activity as a speaker afforded a remarkable contrast to the
quieter style of his more celebrated son.</p>
<p>Accidentally looking into the life of Bishop Bathurst, I find
printed in the Appendix some interesting conversations at
Earlham, where Joseph John Gurney lived.&nbsp; On one occasion,
when Dr. Chalmers was staying there, Joseph John Gurney writes:
&lsquo;W. Y. breakfasted with us, and with his usual strong sense
and talent called forth the energies of Chalmers&rsquo;
mind.&nbsp; They conversed on the subject of special Providence,
and of the unseen yet unceasing superintendence of the Creator of
all the events which occur in this lower world.&nbsp; Said W. Y.:
&ldquo;Mr. Barbauld, the husband of the authoress, was once a
resident in my house.&nbsp; He was a man of low opinions in
religion, and denied the agency of an unseen spirit on the mind
of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remarked that when the mind was determined
to a certain right action by a combination of circumstances <!--
page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>productive of the adequate motives, and meeting from
various quarters precisely at the right point for the purpose in
view, this was in itself a sufficient evidence of an especial
Providence, and might be regarded as the instrumentality through
which the Holy Spirit acts.&nbsp; Mr. Barbauld admitted the
justice of this argument.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again I read: &lsquo;W. Y.
supported the doctrine that nature is governed through the means
of general laws&mdash;laws which broadly and obviously mark the
wisdom and benevolence of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; One extract more:
&lsquo;W. Y. expressed his admiration of the masterly manner in
which Dr. Chalmers, in his &ldquo;Bridgewater Treatise,&rdquo;
has fixed on the atheist a moral obligation to inquire into the
truth of religion; but, said he, might not the disciples of
Irving, by the same rule, oblige us to an inquiry into the
supposed evidences of their favourite doctrine that Christ is
about to appear and to reign personally on earth?&nbsp; Might not
even the Mahometan suppose in the Christian a similar necessity
as it relates to the pretensions of the false
prophet?&rsquo;&nbsp; If Joseph Gurney sent for W. Y. to converse
with Dr. Chalmers as a genial spirit, surely the name of one so
honourable and of one so friendly both to my father and myself
should not be omitted.&nbsp; W. Y. loved a joke.&nbsp; He was
<!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>very stout, and wore tight black knee breeches with
shoes and silk stockings.&nbsp; I remember how he made me laugh
one day as he described what happened to his knee-breeches as he
stooped to tie up his shoes ere attending a place of
worship.&nbsp; To cut a long story short, I may add W. Youngman
did not go to church that day.&nbsp; Originally I think he was a
dyer.</p>
<p>Harriet Martineau, as all the world knows, was born at
Norwich.&nbsp; In her somewhat ill-natured autobiography she
writes: &lsquo;Norwich, which has now no social claims to
superiority at all, was in my childhood a rival of Lichfield
itself, in the time of the Sewards, for literary pretensions and
the vulgarity of pedantry.&nbsp; William Taylor was then at his
best, when there was something like fulfilment of his early
promise, when his exemplary filial duty was a fine spectacle to
the whole city, and before the vice which destroyed him had
coarsened his morale and destroyed his intellect.&nbsp; During
the war it was a great distinction to know anything of German
literature, and in Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s case it proved a ruinous
distinction.&nbsp; He was completely spoiled by the flatteries of
shallow men, pedantic women, and conceited lads.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet
this man was the friend of Southey and opened up a <!-- page
218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>new world to the English intellect, and perhaps in days
to come will have a more enduring reputation than Harriet
Martineau herself.&nbsp; The lady does not err on the side of
good nature in her criticism.&nbsp; All she can say of Dr. Sayers
is: &lsquo;I always heard of him as a genuine scholar, and I have
no doubt he was superior to his neighbours in modesty and
manners.&nbsp; Dr. Enfield, a feeble and superficial man of
letters, was gone also from the literary supper-table before my
time.&nbsp; There was Sir James Smith, the botanist, made much of
and really not pedantic and vulgar like the rest, but weak and
irritable.&nbsp; There was Dr. Alderson, Mrs. Opie&rsquo;s
father, solemn and sententious and eccentric in manner, but not
an able man in any way;&rsquo; and thus the leading lights of
Norwich are contemptuously dismissed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The great days
of the Gurneys were not come yet.&nbsp; The remarkable family
from which issued Mrs. Fry and Priscilla and Joseph John Gurney
were then a set of dashing young people, dressed in gay riding
habits and scarlet boots, as Mrs. Fry told us afterwards, and
riding about the country to balls and gaieties of all
sorts.&nbsp; Accomplished and charming young ladies they were;
and we children used to overhear some whispered gossip about the
effects of their charms <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>on
heart-stricken young men; but their final characteristics were
not yet apparent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is to a Norwich man that we owe the publication of
Hansard&rsquo;s Parliamentary Debates.&nbsp; Luke Hansard, to
whom they owe their name, was born in Norwich, 1725, was trained
as a printer, went to London with but a guinea in his pocket, was
employed by Hughes, the printer of the House of Commons,
succeeded to the business and became widely known for his
despatch and accuracy in printing Parliamentary papers and
debates.&nbsp; He died in 1828, but the business was continued by
his family, and to refer to Hansard became the invariable custom
when an M.P. was to be condemned out of his own mouth&mdash;as
Hansard was supposed never to err.&nbsp; Recently Hansard has
been carried on by a company, but the old name still remains.</p>
<p>Dr. Stoughton has in vain, in a number of the
<i>Congregationalist</i>, attempted to record the memory of a man
well known and much honoured in his day&mdash;the Rev. John
Alexander, of Norwich.&nbsp; The portrait is a failure.&nbsp; It
gives us no idea of the man with his rosy face, his curly black
hair, his merry, twinkling eye, his joyous laugh, when mirth
befitted the occasion, or his tender sympathy <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>where pain
and sorrow and distress had to be endured.&nbsp; Mr.
Alexander&rsquo;s jubilee was celebrated in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall in 1867, when the Mayor and a crowd of citizens did him
honour, and a sum of money for the purchase of an annuity was
presented, thus obviating the necessity of doing to him as on one
occasion he in his humorous way suggested should be done with old
ministers when past work&mdash;that they should be shot.&nbsp; In
1817 Mr. Alexander had come to Norwich to preach in the old
Whitfield Tabernacle in place of Mr. Hooper, one of the tutors at
Hoxton Academy.&nbsp; When I went to Norwich he had built a fine
chapel in Prince&rsquo;s Street, and amongst the hearers was Mr.
Tillet, then in a lawyer&rsquo;s office, a young man famous for
his speeches at the Mechanics&rsquo; Institute and in connection
with a literary venture, the <i>Norwich Magazine</i>, not
destined to set the Thames on fire; latterly an M.P. for Norwich
and proprietor and editor, I believe, of one of the most popular
of East Anglian journals, the <i>Norfolk News</i>.&nbsp; It was
in Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel I first learned to realize how
influential was the Nonconformist public, of which I frankly
admit in our little village, with Churchmen all round, I had but
a limited idea.&nbsp; It seemed to me that we were rather a puny
folk, <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>but at Norwich, with its chapels and
pastors and people, I saw another sight.&nbsp; There was the Rev.
John Alexander, with an overflowing audience on the Sunday and an
active vitality all the week, now dining at the palace with the
Bishop or breakfasting at Earlham with the Gurneys, now meeting
on terms of equality the literati of the place (at that time Mrs.
Opie was still living near the castle, and Mr. Wilkins was
writing his life of the far-famed Norwich doctor, the learned and
ingenious author of the &lsquo;Religio Medici&rsquo;), now
visiting the afflicted and the destitute, now carrying
consolation to the home of the mourner.&nbsp; John Alexander was
a man to whom East Anglian Nonconformity owes much.&nbsp; In the
old city there was a good deal of young intelligence, and a good
deal of it amongst the Noncons.&nbsp; Dr. Sexton was one of the
Old Meeting House congregation, as was Lucy Brightwell, a lady
not unknown to the present generation of readers.&nbsp; To a
certain extent a Noncon. is bound to be more or less
intelligent.&nbsp; He finds a great State Establishment of
religion wherever he goes.&nbsp; It enjoys the favour of the
Court.&nbsp; It is patronized by the aristocracy.&nbsp; It
enlists among its supporters all who wish to rise in the world or
to make a figure in society.&nbsp; By means of the endowed <!--
page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>schools of the land, it offers to the young, even of
the humblest birth, a chance of winning a prize.&nbsp; Conform,
it says, and you may be rich and respectable.&nbsp; It was said
of a late Bishop of Winchester that he would forgive a man
anything so long as he were but a good Churchman, and even now
one meets in society with people who regard a Dissenter as little
better than a heathen or a publican.&nbsp; A man who can thus
voluntarily place himself at a disadvantage, to a certain extent,
must have exercised his intellect and be ready to give a reason
for the faith that is in him.&nbsp; Naturally, men are of the
religion of the country in which they are born&mdash;Roman
Catholics in Italy, Mahometans in Turkey, Buddhists in the
East.&nbsp; It requires more power and strength of mind and
decision of character to dissent from the Church of the State
than to support it.&nbsp; &lsquo;How was it,&rsquo; asked Dr.
Storrar, Chairman of the Convocation of the University of London,
the other day, &lsquo;that the lads educated at Mill Hill Grammar
School had done so well at Cambridge and Oxford?&rsquo;&nbsp; The
reply, said the Doctor, was&mdash;I don&rsquo;t give his words,
merely the idea&mdash;to be found in the fact that a couple of
centuries ago there were men of strong intellect and tender
consciences who refused <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>to renounce
their opinions at the command of a despotic power.&nbsp; They had
been succeeded by their sons with the same quickness of intellect
and conscience.&nbsp; Generations one after another had come and
gone, and the children of these old Nonconformists thus came to
the school with an hereditary intelligence, destined to win in
the gladiatorship of the school, the college, or the world.</p>
<p>Let me now give an anecdote of Dr. Bathurst, the Lord Bishop
of Norwich, too good to be lost.&nbsp; It is told by Sir Charles
Leman, who described him in 1839 as gradually converting his
enemies into friends by his uniform straightforwardness and
enlarged Christian principle.&nbsp; One of his clergy, who had
been writing most abusively in newspapers, had on one occasion
some favour to solicit, which he did with natural
hesitation.&nbsp; The Bishop promised all in his power and in the
kindest manner, and when the clergyman was about to leave the
room he suddenly turned with, &lsquo;My lord, I must say,
however, I much regret the part I have taken against you; I see I
was quite in the wrong, and I beg your forgiveness.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This was readily accorded.&nbsp; &lsquo;But how was it,&rsquo;
the clergyman continued, &lsquo;you did not turn your back on
<!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>me?&nbsp; I quite expected it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
you forget that I profess myself a Christian,&rsquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>Of a later Bishop&mdash;Stanley&mdash;whom I can well
remember, a dark, energetic little man, making a speech at Exeter
Hall, we hear a little in Caroline Fox&rsquo;s memories of old
friends.&nbsp; In 1848 she writes: &lsquo;Dined very pleasantly
at the palace; the Bishop was all animation and good humour, but
too unsettled to leave any memorable impression.&nbsp; I like
Mrs. Stanley much&mdash;a shrewd, sensible, observing
woman.&nbsp; She told me much about her Bishop, how very trying
his position was on first settling at Norwich; for his
predecessor was an amiable, indolent old man, who let things take
their course, and a very bad course too, all which the present
man has to correct as way opens, and continually sacrifice
popularity to a sense of right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following anecdote of Miss Fox and her friends calling at
a cottage in the neighbourhood of Norwich is too good to be
lost.&nbsp; &lsquo;A young woman,&rsquo; she writes, &lsquo;told
us that her father was nearly converted, and that a little more
teaching would complete the business,&rsquo; adding, &lsquo;He
quite believes that he is lost, which is, of course, a great
consolation to the old man.&rsquo;&nbsp; That story is racy of
the soil.&nbsp; It is in that way the East Anglian peasantry <!--
page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>who have any religion at all talk; they have no hope of
a man who does not feel that he is lost.&nbsp; Well, there are
many ways to heaven, and that must comfort some of us who still
believe that man was made in the image of his Maker, a little
lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour, and not
destined to an eternity of misery for the sins of a day.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The Orwell&mdash;The Sparrows&mdash;Ipswich
notabilities&mdash;Gainsborough&mdash;Medical
men&mdash;Nonconformists.</p>
<p>Those who imagine Suffolk to be a flat and uninteresting
county, with no charms for the eye and no associations worth
speaking of, are much mistaken.&nbsp; There are few lovelier
rivers in England than the Orwell, on which Ipswich stands, up
which river the fiery Danes used to sail to plunder all the
country round, and on the banks of which Gainsborough learned to
love Nature and draw her in all her charms.&nbsp; The town itself
stands in a valley, but it has gradually crept up the hills on
each side, so that almost everywhere you have a pleasing prospect
and breathe a bracing air.&nbsp; A few miles, or, rather, a short
walk, brings you to Henley, which has the reputation of being the
highest land in Suffolk, and on the other side there is a railway
that connects Ipswich with Felixstowe, <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>just as the
Crystal Palace is connected with the City.&nbsp; Ipswich may
claim to be the most prosperous and enterprising of all the
Suffolk towns.&nbsp; It goes with the times.&nbsp; Its citizens
are active and pushing men of business, and have enlightened
ideas as well.&nbsp; They are also Liberal in politics and
practical in religion, and are never behind in coming forward
when there is a chance of benefiting themselves or their
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; And yet Ipswich has a history as long as
the dullest cathedral town.&nbsp; It was a place of note during
the existence of the Saxon Heptarchy.&nbsp; Twice it had the
honour of publicly entertaining King John; and there is a
tradition that in the curious and beautifully-ornamented house in
the Butter Market&mdash;formerly the residence of Mr. Sparrow,
the Ipswich coroner, whose old family portraits, including one of
the Jameses, presented to an ancestor of the family, filled me
not a little with youthful wonder&mdash;Charles II. was secreted
by one of the Sparrows of that day, when he came to hide in
Ipswich after the battle of Worcester.&nbsp; &lsquo;The house is
now a shop,&rsquo; but, observes Mr. Glyde, a far-famed local
historian, &lsquo;a concealed room in the upper story of the
house, which was discovered during some alterations in 1801, is
well adapted for such a <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>purpose.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, at any rate, the gay and
graceless monarch, in search of a hiding-place, might have gone
farther and fared worse.&nbsp; Be that as it may, Ipswich can
rejoice in the fact that it was the birthplace of Cardinal
Wolsey; and that he was one of the first educational reformers of
the day must be admitted, at any rate, in Ipswich, of which,
possibly, he would have made a second Cambridge.&nbsp; Alas! of
his efforts in that direction, the only outward and visible sign
is the old gateway in what is called College Street, which
remains to this day.&nbsp; Ipswich fared well in the Elizabethan
days, when her Gracious Majesty condescended to visit the
place.&nbsp; Sir Christopher Hatton, the dancing Lord Chancellor,
who led the brawls, when</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The seals and maces danced before
him,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lived in a house near the Church of St. Mary-le-Tower.&nbsp;
Sir Edward Coke resided in a village not far off, and in 1597 the
M.P. for Ipswich was no other than the great Lord Bacon, who by
birth and breeding was emphatically a Suffolk man.&nbsp; From
Windham&rsquo;s diary, it appears that at Ipswich that
distinguished statesman experienced a new sensation.&nbsp; In
1789 he writes: &lsquo;Left Ipswich not till near twelve.&nbsp;
Saw Humphries there, and <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>was for the
first time entertained with some sparring; felt much amused with
the whole of the business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the early part of the present century Miss Berry, on
returning from one of her Continental trips, paid Ipswich a
visit, having landed at Southwold.&nbsp; &lsquo;Appearance of
Ipswich very pretty in descending towards it,&rsquo; is the entry
in her diary.&nbsp; About the same time Bishop Bathurst made his
visitation tour, and he writes to one of his lady correspondents:
&lsquo;You will be glad that, during the three weeks I passed in
Suffolk, I did not meet a single unpleasant man, nor experience a
single unpleasant accident.&rsquo;&nbsp; With the name of the
Suffolk hero Captain Broke, of the <i>Shannon</i>.&nbsp; (I can
well remember the Shannon coach&mdash;which ran from Yoxford to
London&mdash;the only day-coach we had at that time), Ipswich is
inseparably connected.&nbsp; He was born at Broke Hall, just by,
and there spent the later years of his life.&nbsp; Another of our
naval heroes, Admiral Vernon, the victor of Porto Bello, resided
in the same vicinity.&nbsp; At one time there seems to have been
an attempt to connect Ipswich with the Iron Duke.&nbsp; In the
memoir of Admiral Broke we have more than one reference to the
Duke&rsquo;s shooting in that neighbourhood, <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>and
actually it appears that, unknown to himself, he was nominated as
a candidate to the office of High Steward.&nbsp; Ipswich,
however, preferred a neighbour, in the shape of Sir Robert
Harland.&nbsp; At a later day the office was filled by Mr.
Charles Austin, the distinguished writer on Jurisprudence.</p>
<p>One of the celebrated noblemen who lived in Ipswich was Lord
Chedworth.&nbsp; He wore top-boots, and wore them till they were
not fit to be seen.&nbsp; When new boots were sent home he was
accustomed to set them on one side, and get his manservant to
wear them a short time to prepare them for his own feet.&nbsp;
Sometimes the man would tell his lordship that he thought the
boots were ready, but his lordship would generally reply,
&lsquo;Never mind, William; wear them another week.&rsquo;&nbsp;
While at Ipswich his lordship was frequently consulted, owing to
his legal attainments and well-known generous disposition, by
tradesmen and people in indigent circumstances.&nbsp; The
applicants were ushered into the library, where, surrounded by
books, they found his lordship.&nbsp; The chairs and furniture of
the room, like his lordship&rsquo;s clothes, had not merely seen
their best days, but were comparatively worthless, and the old
red cloak which invariably enveloped his shoulders made him look
<!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>more like a gipsy boy than a peer of the realm.&nbsp;
His lordship&rsquo;s legacies to Ipswich ladies and others,
especially of the theatrical profession, were of the most liberal
character.</p>
<p>Ipswich in its old days had its share of witches.&nbsp; One of
the most notorious of them was Mother Hatheland, who in due
course was tried, condemned and executed.&nbsp; From her
confession in 1645 it appears &lsquo;the said Mother Hatheland
hath been a professor of religion, a constant hearer of the Word
for these many years, yet a witch, as she confessed, for the
space of nearly twenty years.&nbsp; The devil came to her first
between sleeping and waking, and spake to her in a hollow voice,
telling her that if she would serve him she would want
nothing.&nbsp; After often solicitations she consented to
him.&nbsp; Then he stroke his claw (as she confessed) into her
hands, and with her blood wrote the covenant.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now,
as the writer gravely remarks, the subtlety of Satan is to be
observed in that he did not press her to deny God and Christ, as
he did others, because she was a professor, and he might have
lost all his hold by pressing her too far.&nbsp; Satan appears to
have provided her with three imps, in the shape of two little
dogs and a mole.</p>
<p><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>As the home of Gainsborough Ipswich has enduring claims
on the English nation and on lovers of art and artists
everywhere.&nbsp; That must have been a Suffolk man who passed
the following criticism on Gainsborough&rsquo;s celebrated
picture of &lsquo;Girl and Pigs,&rsquo; of which Sir Joshua
Reynolds became the purchaser at one hundred guineas, though the
artist asked but sixty: &lsquo;They be deadly like pigs; but who
ever saw pigs feeding together, but one on &rsquo;em had a foot
in the trough?&rsquo;&nbsp; Gainsborough had an enthusiastic
attachment to music.&nbsp; It was the favourite amusement of his
leisure hours, and his love for it induced him to give one or two
concerts to his most intimate acquaintances whilst living in
Ipswich.&nbsp; He was a member of a musical club, and painted
some of the portraits of his brother members in his picture of a
choir.&nbsp; Once upon a time, Gainsborough was examined as a
witness on a trial respecting the originality of a picture.&nbsp;
The barrister on the other side said: &lsquo;I observe you lay
great stress on a painter&rsquo;s eye; what do you mean by that
expression?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A painter&rsquo;s eye,&rsquo;
replied Gainsborough, &lsquo;is to him what the lawyer&rsquo;s
eye is to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a boy at the Grammar School of his
native town, it is to be feared he loved to play truant.&nbsp;
One day he went out to his <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>usual
sketching haunts to enjoy the nature which he loved heartily,
previously presenting to his uncle, who was master of the school,
the usual slip of paper, &lsquo;Give Tom a holiday,&rsquo; in
which his father&rsquo;s handwriting was so exactly imitated that
not the slightest suspicion of the forgery ever entered the mind
of the master.&nbsp; Alas! however, the crime was detected, and
his terrified parent exclaimed in despair, &lsquo;Tom will one
day be hanged.&rsquo;&nbsp; When, however, he was informed how
the truant schoolboy had employed his truant hours, and the
boy&rsquo;s sketches were laid before him, forgetful of the
consequences of forgeries in a commercial society, he declared,
with all the pride of a father, &lsquo;Tom will be a
genius,&rsquo; and he was right.</p>
<p>Worthy Mr. Pickwick seems to have known Ipswich about the same
time as myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the main street of
Ipswich,&rsquo; wrote the biographer of that distinguished
individual, &lsquo;on the left-hand side of the way, a short
distance after you have passed through the open space fronting
the Town Hall, stands an inn known far and wide by the
appellation of the Great White Horse, rendered the more
conspicuous by a stone statue of some rapacious animal, with
flowing mane and tail, distantly <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>resembling
an insane carthorse, which is elevated above the principal
door.&nbsp; The Great White Horse is famous in the neighbourhood
in the same degree as a prize ox, a county paper chronicled
turnip, or unwieldy pig, for its enormous size.&nbsp; Never were
such labyrinths of uncarpeted passages, such clusters of mouldy,
ill-lighted rooms, such huge numbers of small dens for eating or
sleeping in, beneath any one roof as are collected together
between the four walls of the Great White Horse of
Ipswich.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was the great hotel of the Ipswich of
my youth.&nbsp; As regards hotels, Ipswich has not improved, but
in every other way it has much advanced.&nbsp; One of the old
inns has been turned into a fine public hall, admirably adapted
for concerts and public meetings.&nbsp; The new Town Hall, Corn
Exchange, and Post-office are a credit to the town.&nbsp; The
same may be said of the new Museum and the Grammar School and the
Working Men&rsquo;s College and that health resort, the
Arboretum; while by means of the new dock ships of fifteen
hundred tons burden can load and unload.&nbsp; Nowadays everybody
says Ipswich is a rising town, and what everyone says must be
right.&nbsp; The Ipswich people, at any rate, have firmly got
that idea into their heads.&nbsp; Its fathers and founders <!--
page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>built the streets narrow, evidently little anticipating
for Ipswich the future it has since achieved.&nbsp; The Ipswich
of to-day is laid out on quite a different scale.&nbsp; It has a
tram road service evidently much in excess of the present
population, and as you wander in the suburbs you come to a
sign-post bearing the name of a street in which not even the
enterprise of the speculative builder has been able at present to
plant a single dwelling.&nbsp; When Ipswich has climbed up its
surrounding hills, and taken up all the building sites at present
in the market, it will be a goodly and gallant town, almost
fitted to invite the temporary residence of holiday-making
Londoners who are fond of the water.&nbsp; At all times it is a
pretty sail to Harwich and thence to Felixstowe, that quiet
watering-place, a seaside residence that has still a pleasant
flavour of rusticity about it, with a fine crisp sea-sand floor
for a promenade.</p>
<p>When I was a boy Ipswich was resorted to by Londoners in the
summer-time.&nbsp; As an illustration, I give the case of Mr.
Ewen, one of the deacons of the Weigh House Chapel, when the Rev.
John Clayton was the pastor.&nbsp; In his memories of the Clayton
family, the Rev. Dr. Aveling writes of Mr. Ewen, that &lsquo;he
was so sensitively conscientious <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>in the
discharge of his official duties at the Weigh House, that he was
never absent from town on the days when the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
was administered, and when he was expected to assist in the
administration of the elements.&nbsp; His London residence was in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, but having a house and property in
the town of Ipswich, he passed his summer months there.&nbsp; Yet
so intent was he upon duly filling his place in the sanctuary of
God, that he regularly travelled by post-chaise once in every
month, and returned in the same manner, that he might be present,
together with his pastor and the brethren, at the table of the
Lord.&nbsp; The length and the expense of the journey (and
travelling was not then what it is now) did not deter him from
what he at least deemed to be a matter of Christian
obligation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Aveling is quite right when he tells
us travelling is not what it was.&nbsp; It took almost a day to
go from Ipswich to London when I was a boy, and now the journey
is done by means of the Great Eastern Railway in about an hour
and a half.&nbsp; It seems marvellous to one who, like myself,
remembers well the past, to leave Liverpool Street at 5.0 p.m.
precisely, and to find one&rsquo;s self landed safe and well in
Ipswich soon after half-past six.&nbsp; The present generation
can <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>have no conception of travelling in
England in the olden time.</p>
<p>There were some wonderful old Radicals in Ipswich, though it
was, and is, the county town of the most landlord-ridden district
in England.&nbsp; Some of them got the great Dan O&rsquo;Connell
to pay the town a visit, and some of them nobly stood by old John
Childs when he became famous all the world over as the
Church-rate martyr.&nbsp; The lawyers and the doctors were mostly
Tories, but the tradesmen and the merchants were not a little
leavened with the leaven of Dissent.&nbsp; Mr. Hammond was,
however, a Liberal surgeon, and as such flourished.&nbsp; His
Whig principles, writes Mr. Glyde, brought him many patients, and
his skill and sound qualities retained them.&nbsp; Dr. Garrord,
the well-known London practitioner, was an apprentice of Mr.
Hammond&rsquo;s; and this reminds me that among the Ipswich men
who have risen is Mr. Sprigg, the Premier of Cape Colony when Sir
Bartle Frere was at the head of affairs there.&nbsp; The father
of Mr. Sprigg was the respected pastor of a Baptist chapel in the
town.&nbsp; The only Ipswich minister whom I can remember was the
Rev. Mr. Notcutt, who preached in the leading Independent chapel,
now pulled down to make way for a much more <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>attractive
building.&nbsp; All I can recollect about him is, that once, when
a lad, I fainted away when he was preaching.&nbsp; No sermon ever
affected me so since; and that effect was due, it must be
confessed, not to the preacher, who seemed to me rather aged and
asthmatic, but to the heat of the place, in consequence of the
crowd attracted to the meeting-house on some special
occasion.</p>
<p>But to return to the doctors.&nbsp; Of one of them, who was
famed for his love of bleeding his patients, not metaphorically,
but in the old-fashioned way, with the lancet, it is recorded
that on the occasion of his taking a holiday two of his patients
died.&nbsp; Lamenting the fact to a friend, the following epigram
was the result:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;B--- kills two patients while from home
away&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A clever fellow this same B---, I wot;<br />
If absent thus his patients he can slay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How he must kill them when he&rsquo;s on the
spot!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps one of the noted physicians of my boyhood was Mr.
Stebbing.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was once,&rsquo; writes Mr. Glyde,
&lsquo;called in to see one of the Ipswich Dissenting ministers,
who had taken life very easily, and had grown corpulent.&nbsp;
After examining the patient and hearing his statement as to
bodily state, he replied: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no particular
ailment; <!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>mind and keep your eyes longer open,
and your mouth longer shut, and you will do very well in a short
time.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; On another occasion a raw and very
poor-looking young fellow called upon him for advice.&nbsp; The
doctor told him to go home and eat more pudding, adding,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all you want; physic is a very good thing for
one to live by, but a precious bad thing for you to
take.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of the Ipswich characters of my boyhood,
of whom Mr. Glyde has preserved an anecdote, was old Tuxford, the
veterinary surgeon.&nbsp; He used to declare that he never took
more than one meal a day&mdash;a breakfast; but when asked of
what that consisted, he said, &lsquo;A pound of beefsteak, seven
eggs, three cups of tea, and a quartern of rum.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
may also be mentioned that before Mrs. Garrett Anderson was born,
Ipswich had a lady physician in the person of Miss Stebbing,
daughter of the doctor to whom I have already referred.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She was,&rsquo; says one who knew her well, &lsquo;a woman
of general education, with more than ordinary tact and
discernment, combined with the true womanly power of analyzing
and observing.&nbsp; She had good physical powers, and, like her
worthy father, was somewhat pungent in her remarks and eccentric
in her habits.&nbsp; She entered the ranks as a medical
practitioner during her father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The <!-- page
240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>benefit of his advice so aided her perceptive powers as
to make her quite an expert in various ways, and she continued to
practise long after his decease, occasionally attending males as
well as females.&nbsp; Her knowledge of midwifery caused a large
number of ladies to engage her services.</p>
<p>Of the Radicals of Ipswich, the only one with whom I came into
contact was Mr. John King, the proprietor and editor of what was
then, at any rate, a far-famed journal&mdash;the <i>Suffolk
Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; Astronomy was his hobby, and he had ideas on
the subject which, unfortunately, I failed to catch.&nbsp; He had
built himself an observatory, if I remember aright, at his
residence on Rose Hill, where he would sweep the heavens nightly,
to see what could be seen.&nbsp; He was a Radical of the old
type, a tall, dark, bilious-looking man, a little hard and dry,
perhaps, who seemed to think that it was no use to throw pearls
before swine, and to serve up for the chaw-bacons a too rich
intellectual treat, and his policy was a successful one.&nbsp;
Priest-ridden as Suffolk was, the <i>Suffolk Chronicle</i> was
the leading paper of the county, and had a large circulation,
and, let me add, did good service in its day.&nbsp; Now I find
Ipswich rejoices in a well-conducted daily journal, the <i>East
Anglian Times</i>, which I hear, and <!-- page 241--><a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>am glad to
hear, is a fine property, and I see all the leading towns in
Suffolk have a paper to themselves, even if they can&rsquo;t get
up a decent paragraph of local news&mdash;and some of them I
know, from my experiences of Suffolk life, are quite unequal to
that&mdash;once a week.&nbsp; The plan is to have some sheets
already printed in London, at some great establishment, whence
perhaps a hundred little towns are supplied, and then the local
news and advertisements are added on, and Little Pedlington has
its <i>Observer</i>, and Eatanswill its <i>Gazette</i>.&nbsp;
When I was a boy, such a thing was out of the question, as to
each paper a fourpenny-halfpenny stamp was attached.&nbsp; As the
stamps had to be paid for in advance, and as, besides, there was
an eighteen-penny duty on every advertisement, it was not quite
such an easy matter to run a paper then as it has since
become.&nbsp; I fancy the old-established journals suffered much
by the change, which completely revolutionized the newspaper
trade; at any rate, so far as the country was concerned.&nbsp; In
this connection, let me add that it was to an Ipswich journalist
we owe the establishment of penny readings on anything like a
large and successful scale.&nbsp; They were originated by Mr.
Sully, at that time the proprietor and editor of the <i>Ipswich
</i><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span><i>Express</i>, a paper intended to
steer between the ferocious Toryism of the <i>Ipswich
Journal</i>, and the equally ferocious Radicalism of the
<i>Suffolk Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; As was to be expected, the
attempt did not succeed.&nbsp; As in love and in war, so in
politics and theology, moderation is a thing hateful to gods and
men.&nbsp; The electioneering annals of Ipswich can testify to
that fact.&nbsp; I have a dim recollection of an election
petition which ended in Sir Fitzroy Kelly&rsquo;s admitting that
he had stated what was not true, but he did it as a lawyer, not
as a gentleman, and in sending one of the finest old gentlemen I
ever knew to gaol, because he would not tell what he knew of the
matter.&nbsp; There was not much half-and-half work in the
Ipswich politics of my young days.</p>
<p>When people fight fiercely in politics, it is natural to
expect an equal earnestness in religious matters.&nbsp; It was so
emphatically with respect to the Ipswich of the past.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Reformed religion, after those fiery days of
persecution,&rsquo; writes John Quick, &lsquo;was now revived,
and flourished again in the country, under the auspicious name of
our English Deborah, Queen Elizabeth; and Ipswich, the capital
town of Suffolk, was not more famous for its spacious sheds,
large and beautiful buildings, rich and great trade, <!-- page
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>and honourable merchants, both at home and abroad, than
it was for its learned and godly ministers and its religious
intolerants.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of the godly ministers, one of the most
famous was Samuel Ward, who was buried in St. Mary-le-Tower
Church.&nbsp; In 1666 he preached a sermon at St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cross.&nbsp; But he meddled with politics.&nbsp; For instance, in
1621 he published a caricature picture, entitled &lsquo;Spayne
and Rome Defeated.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is thus described: The Pope
and his Council are represented in the centre of the piece, and
beneath, on one side the Armada, and on the other the Gunpowder
Treason.&nbsp; Gondomar, the Spanish Ambassador, complained of it
as insulting to his master.&nbsp; Ward was placed in
custody.&nbsp; Being Puritanically inclined, he was, in addition,
prosecuted in the Consistory Court of Norwich by Bishop Harsnet
for Nonconformity.&nbsp; Ten years later, when 600 persons were
contemplating a removal from Ipswich to New England&mdash;as a
place where they could worship God without fear of priest or
king&mdash;the blame was cast by Laud on Ward.&nbsp; Rushworth
informs us that the charges laid against him were that he
preached against the common bowing at the name of Jesus and
against the King&rsquo;s &lsquo;Book of Sports,&rsquo; and
further said that <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>the Church of England was ready to
ring changes in England, and that the Gospel stood on tiptoe as
ready to be gone; and for this he was removed from his
lectureship and sent to gaol.&nbsp; John Ward, his brother,
Rector of St. Clement&rsquo;s, was a member of the Assembly of
Divines, and was called to preach two sermons before the House of
Commons, for which he received the thanks of the House.&nbsp; At
that time we find a reference to Ipswich as a place which
&lsquo;the Lord hath long made famous and happy as a valley of
Gospel vision.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such places, alas! seem to have been
commoner formerly than they are now.</p>
<p>One of the Congregational churches of Ipswich, at any rate,
has very interesting historical associations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Salem
Chapel,&rsquo; writes the Rev. John Browne, in his &lsquo;History
of Congregationalism in Suffolk and Norfolk,&rsquo; &lsquo;stands
in St. George&rsquo;s Lane, opposite the place where St.
George&rsquo;s Chapel formerly stood, where Bilney was
apprehended when preaching in favour of the Reformation, and
where he so enraged the monks that they twice plucked him out of
the pulpit.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last time I was at Ipswich I saw
bricklayers at work at the old Presbyterian church in St.
Nicholas Street, which it would be a pity to see modernized,
being <!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>such a fine illustration of the
old-fashioned Dissenting Meeting-house, before it became the
fashion to have a taste and to build Gothic chapels in which it
is difficult to see or hear, and the only advantage of which is
that they are an exact copy of the steeple-houses against which
at one time Nonconformist England waged remorseless war.&nbsp;
One of the pastors of this congregation removed to Mill Hill
Chapel, Leeds, where he succeeded Dr. Priestley; another was the
author of a &lsquo;History and Description of Derbyshire&rsquo;;
while one of the supplies was the Rev. Robert Alderson,
afterwards of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, who ultimately became
a lawyer and Recorder of Norwich.&nbsp; Perhaps one of the most
singular scenes connected with Dissenting chapels in Ipswich was
that which took place in the old chapel in Tackard, now Tacket,
Street.&nbsp; In 1766 the minister there was the Rev. Mr.
Edwards, who, it appears, was sent for to the gaol to see two men
who had been found guilty of house-breaking, and who, according
to the law as it then stood, were to be hung.&nbsp; Mr. Edwards
did so, and stayed with them two hours.&nbsp; As the result of
this visit they were brought to a penitent state of mind.&nbsp;
They had heard that Mr. Edwards had prepared a sermon for them
and <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>desired them to attend.&nbsp; This
was a mistake, but notwithstanding they obtained permission to go
to the chapel, where Mr. Edwards was conducting a church
meeting.&nbsp; A report of the purpose got abroad, and many
persons came to the meeting, upon which it was thought most
proper that the church business should be laid aside, and that
Mr. Edwards should go into the pulpit.&nbsp; This he did, and
after singing and prayer the prisoners came in with their
shackles and fetters on.&nbsp; Mr. Edwards, in describing the
scene, says:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many were moved at the sight.&nbsp; As for myself, I
was obliged for some time to stop to give vent to tears.&nbsp;
When I recovered I gave out part of a hymn suitable to the
occasion, then prayed.&nbsp; The subject of discourse was,
&ldquo;This is a faithful saying,&rdquo; and the poor prisoners
shed abundance of tears while I was explaining the several parts
of the text, and especially when I turned and addressed myself
immediately to them.&nbsp; The house was thronged, and I suppose
not a dry eye in the whole place&mdash;nothing but weeping and
sorrow; and the floods of tears which gushed from the eyes of the
two prisoners were very melting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good man continues: &lsquo;When we had concluded I went
and spoke some encouraging words <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>by way of
supporting them under their sorrow.&nbsp; They then desired I
should see them in the evening, which I did, and called upon Mr.
Blindle on the way; the old gentleman went along with me to the
prison, and was one who prayed with them with much fervour and
enlargement of heart.&nbsp; We spent nearly two hours with them,
and a crowd of people were present.&rsquo;&nbsp; On another
occasion we find an American Indian preaching in the
pulpit&mdash;a novelty in 1767.&nbsp; He came over with a Dr.
Whitaker, of Norwich, in America, to collect money for the
education and conversion of Indians, and at Tackard Street the
people raised the very respectable sum of &pound;80 for the
purpose.&nbsp; In 1561 Queen Elizabeth paid Ipswich a
visit.&nbsp; At that time the place was a little too Protestant
for her.&nbsp; Strype writes: &lsquo;Here Her Majesty took a
great dislike to the impudent behaviour of most of the ministers
and readers, there being many weak ones among them, and little or
no order observed in the public service, and few or none wearing
the surplice, and the Bishop of Norwich was thought remiss, and
that he winked at schismatics.&nbsp; But more particularly she
was offended with the clergy&rsquo;s marriage, and that in
cathedrals and colleges there were so many wives and children and
widows seen, <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>which, she said, was contrary to the
intent of the founders, and so much tending to the interruption
of the studies of those who were placed there.&nbsp; Therefore
she issued an order to all dignitaries, dated August 9, at
Ipswich, to forbid all women to the lodgings of cathedrals or
colleges, and that upon pain of losing their ecclesiastical
promotion.&rsquo;&nbsp; From this it is clear that when Elizabeth
was Queen there was little chance of the Women&rsquo;s Rights
Question finding a favourable hearing.&nbsp; The Queen was
succeeded by monarchs after her own heart.&nbsp; In 1636 Prynne
published his &lsquo;Newes from Ipswich,&rsquo;
&lsquo;discovering certain late detestable practices of some
domineering Lordly Prelates to undermine the established doctrine
and discipline of our Church, extirpate all orthodox sincere
preachers and preaching of God&rsquo;s Word, usher in popery,
idolatry and superstition.&rsquo;&nbsp; For this publication
Prynne was sentenced to be fined &pound;5,000 to the King, to
lose the remainder of his ears, to be branded on both cheeks, and
to be perpetually imprisoned in Carnarvon Castle.&nbsp; At that
time the Ipswich people were far too Liberal for the powers
existing.&nbsp; Ipswich news nowadays is little calculated to
displease anyone, and governments and kings are less prone to
take <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>offence at the exercise of free
thought and free speech.</p>
<p>Ipswich people make their way.&nbsp; Miss Reeve&mdash;who
wrote the &lsquo;Old English Baron,&rsquo; a popular tale years
ago&mdash;was the daughter of the Rev. William Reeve of St.
Nicholas Church.&nbsp; Another Ipswich lady, Mrs. Keeley, who
lives on in her grand old age, was certainly one of the most
popular performers of her day.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, no city man was better known than
Thomas Firmin, who was born at Ipswich, described in his
biography as &lsquo;a very large and populous town in the county
of Suffolk,&rsquo; in 1632.&nbsp; He was of Puritan parentage,
and bound apprentice in the city of London, and then began
business as a linen-draper on the modest capital of
&pound;100.&nbsp; In a little while he married and was enabled to
dispense a generous hospitality, seeking all opportunities of
becoming acquainted with persons of worth, whether foreigners or
his fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; Amongst his special friends were
Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, and Archbishop Tillotson, at that
time the afternoon lecturer at St. Lawrence&rsquo;s.&nbsp; During
the time of the plague he managed to secure work for the London
poor, and after the fire he erected a warehouse on the banks of
the <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Thames, where coal and corn were
sold at cost price.&nbsp; In 1676 he built a great factory in
Little Britain, for the employment of the needy and industrious
in the linen manufacture; he also relieved poor debtors in
prison.&nbsp; The great work of his later years was in connection
with the Blue Coat School.&nbsp; He was also one of the Governors
of St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital, which he did much to rescue from
the wretched condition in which he found it.&nbsp; When the
French refugees, in consequence of the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes, were driven over to this country, Firmin exerted himself
powerfully on their behalf, and sent some of them to Ipswich to
engage in manufacturing there.&nbsp; He also had a good deal to
do with Ireland, when, as now, the country was torn by contending
factions.&nbsp; At a large expense he also educated many boys and
set them up in trade.&nbsp; He was also one of the first of the
avowed and ardent friends and advocates of a free thought, of
which there were few supporters in England at that day&mdash;even
among the countrymen of Milton and John Locke.&nbsp; Unitarians
were rare in the days when Firmin proclaimed himself one.&nbsp;
Altogether he was one of the best men of his age, and well
deserved to be buried in Christchurch, Newgate, among the
Bluecoat <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>School boys, to whom he had ever
been such a friend, and to have the memorial pillar erected in
his honour by Lady Clayton in Marden Park, Surrey.&nbsp; It is to
be hoped that the memorial remains, though, alas! the noble
mansion at one time inhabited by Wilberforce, and where the great
philanthropist&rsquo;s celebrated son, the Bishop of Oxford was
born, and where I have spent more than one pleasant day when Sir
John Puleston lived there, has been since burnt down.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Woodbridge and the country round&mdash;Bernard
Barton&mdash;Dr. Lankester&mdash;An old Noncon.</p>
<p>The traveller as he leaves the English coast for Antwerp or
Rotterdam or the northern ports of Germany, may remember that the
last glimpse of his native land is the light from Orford Ness,
which is a guiding star to the mariner as he ploughs his weary
way along the deep.&nbsp; Of that part of Suffolk little is known
to the community at large.&nbsp; When I was a boy it was looked
upon as an <i>ultima Thule</i>, where the people were in a
primitive state of civilization; where shops and towns and
newspapers and good roads were unknown; where traditions of
smuggling yet remained.&nbsp; Few ever went into that region, and
those who did, when they returned, did not bring back with them
encouraging reports.&nbsp; Barren sandy moors, along which the
bitter east wind perpetually blew, fatal <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>alike to
vegetation and human life, were the chief characteristics of a
district the natives of which were not rich, at any rate as
regards this world&rsquo;s goods.&nbsp; Orford, like Dunwich, was
once a place of some importance.&nbsp; &lsquo;A large and
populous town with a castle of reddish stone,&rsquo; writes
Camden, but in his time a victim of the sea&rsquo;s ingratitude;
&lsquo;which withdraws itself little by little, and begins to
envy it the advantages of a harbour.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the time of
Henry I., writes Ralph de Coggeshall, when Bartholomew de
Glanville was Governor of its castle, some fishermen there caught
a wild man in their nets.&nbsp; &lsquo;All the parts of his body
resembled those of a man.&nbsp; He had hair on his head, a
long-peaked beard, and about the breast was exceeding hairy and
rough.&nbsp; But at length he made his escape into the sea, and
was never seen more,&rsquo; which was a pity, as undoubtedly he
was the &lsquo;missing link.&rsquo;&nbsp; Besides, as Camden
remarks, the fact was a confirmation of what the common people of
his time remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whatever is produced in any part
of nature is in the sea,&rsquo; and shows &lsquo;that not all is
fabulous what Pliny has written about the Triton on the coasts of
Portugal, and the sea man in the Straits of
Gibraltar.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor is that the only wonder connected
with the district.&nbsp; Close by is <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>Aldborough,
where the poet Crabbe learned to become, as Byron calls him,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s sternest painter, but the
best;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and as Camden writes, &lsquo;Hard by, when in the year 1555
all the corn throughout England was choakt in the ear by
unseasonable weather, the inhabitants tell you that in the
beginning of autumn there grew peas miraculously among the rocks,
and that they relieved the dearth in those parts.&nbsp; But the
more thinking people affirm that pulse cast upon the shore by
shipwreck used to grow there now and then, and so quite exclude
the miracle.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the present the crag-beds are the
most interesting feature to the visitor, especially if he be of a
geological turn.&nbsp; These are so rich in fossil shells that
you may find some of the latter in almost every house in
Ipswich.&nbsp; The Coralline Crag is the oldest bed; but this
formation does not occur in an undisturbed state, except in
Sudbourne Park and about Orford.&nbsp; A drive thither from
Ipswich, through Woodbridge, conveys the traveller through some
of the loveliest scenery in Suffolk, and the numerous exposures
of Coralline Crag in Sudbourne Park, which is about two miles
from Orford, will amply repay the traveller, on account of the
number of fossils which he can there obtain, and the ease <!--
page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>with which he can extract them.&nbsp; In this
neighbourhood live the far-famed Garrett family, one of whom, as
Mrs. Dr. Anderson, is well known in London society, as is also
her sister, Mrs. Fawcett, the wife of the late popular M.P. for
Hackney.&nbsp; Close by is Leiston Abbey, originally one of Black
Canons, consisting of several subterranean chapels, various
offices and a church, which appears to have been a handsome
structure, faced with flint and freestone.&nbsp; The interior was
plain and undecorated, yet massive.&nbsp; A large extent of the
neighbouring fields was enclosed with walls, which have been
demolished, as was to be expected, for the sake of the
materials.&nbsp; We hear much of the dead cities of the Zuyder
Zee.&nbsp; On her eastern coast England has her dead
cities.&nbsp; Dunwich, of which I have already spoken, is
one.&nbsp; Orford, now known solely by its lighthouse, is
another; Blythburgh, in the church of which is the tomb of Anna,
King of the East Angles, who was slain in 654, is a third.&nbsp;
Like Tyre and Sidon, these places had their merchant princes, who
lived delicately, and whose ships traded far and near.&nbsp; It
is said incorrectly of Love, that it</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;At
sight of human ties<br />
Spreads its soft wings and in a moment flies.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remark is truer of commerce, which is a law to <!-- page
256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>itself, and which defies Acts of Parliament and royal
patronage.&nbsp; Hence it is the east coast of Suffolk is so rich
in melancholy remains of ancient cities, now given over to
decay.&nbsp; In my young days the chief town of this district was
Woodbridge.&nbsp; Manufactories were then unknown.&nbsp; The
steam-engine had not then been utilized for the everyday use of
man, and farmers, peasants, coal and corn merchants, solely
inhabited the district, and in Woodbridge especially the latter
rose and flourished for a time.</p>
<p>How it was, I know not, but nevertheless such was the fact,
that the Ipswich of my youthful days seemed to have little, if
any, literary associations connected with it.&nbsp; The
celebrated Mr. Fulcher published his &lsquo;Ladies&rsquo;
Pocket-book&rsquo; at Sudbury, which had a great reputation in
its day, and for which very distinguished people used to
write.&nbsp; It was, in fact, more of an annual than a
pocket-book, and was patronized accordingly.&nbsp; Then there was
James Bird, living at Yoxford, &lsquo;the garden of
Suffolk,&rsquo; as it was called.&nbsp; Woodbridge had a still
higher reputation.&nbsp; James Bird kept a shop, and was supposed
to be a Unitarian; but Bernard Barton was in a bank, and,
besides, he was a Quaker, and Quakers all the world over are,
<!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>or were, famous for their goodness and their
wealth.&nbsp; The fame of the Quaker-poet conferred quite a
literary reputation on the district, and the more so as no one at
that time associated Quakerism with literary faculty in any
way.&nbsp; Now and then, it is true, the Stricklands talked of a
charming young Quaker, who indeed once or twice called at our
house to see Susanna when she was staying there; but Allan
Ransome&mdash;for it is to him I refer&mdash;did not pursue
literature or poetry to any great extent, and instead preferred
to develop the manufacture of agricultural implements&mdash;a
manufacture which, carried on under the same name, is now one of
the chief industries of the busy and thriving town of Ipswich,
and employs quite a thousand men.&nbsp; Woodbridge then bore away
the palm from the county capital, as the home of literature and
poetry and romance.&nbsp; As a town, it is more prettily situated
than are most East Anglian villages and towns.&nbsp; The
principal thoroughfare, as you rode through it by one of the
Yarmouth coaches, that connected it at that time with the
Metropolis, was long and narrow.&nbsp; If you turned off to the
right you came to the Market-place, where were the leading
shops.&nbsp; On your left you reached the Quay and the river,
where a few coasters were employed, chiefly in the <!-- page
258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>coal and corn trade.&nbsp; In our time Woodbridge has
done its duty to the State.&nbsp; Dr. Edwin Lankester the
well-known coroner for Middlesex, came from Melton, close by, the
High Street of which gradually terminates in the Woodbridge
thoroughfare; and the lately deceased Lord Hatherley, one of
England&rsquo;s most celebrated lawyers, was educated in that
district, and took his wife from the same happy land.&nbsp; The
body of the late Lord Hatherley, the great Whig Lord Chancellor,
we were told the other day, was interred in the family vault of
Great Bearings, Suffolk.&nbsp; His mother was a Woodbridge lady,
a Miss Page.&nbsp; Lord Hatherley&rsquo;s father was the
far-famed Liberal Alderman, Sir Matthew Wood, for many years M.P.
for the City of London, and Queen Caroline&rsquo;s trusted friend
and counsellor.&nbsp; Lord Hatherley married, in 1830, Charlotte,
the only daughter of the late Major Edward Moore, of Great
Bealings, Suffolk, but was left a widower in 1878.&nbsp; He
devoted much time to religious work, so long as he had the
strength to undertake it.&nbsp; He was the author of a work
entitled &lsquo;The Continuity of Scripture, as declared by the
Testimony of Our Lord and the Evangelists and the
Apostles&rsquo;, which has passed through three or four
editions.&nbsp; He was created an Hon. D.C.L. of Oxford in 1851,
<!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>was an Hon. Student of Christ Church, Oxford, a
Governor of the Charterhouse, and a member of the
Fishmongers&rsquo; Company, of which his father had at one time
been Prime Warden.&nbsp; Major Moore himself was a great
authority on Suffolk literature and antiquities, and published
more than one book&mdash;now very scarce&mdash;on the interesting
theme.</p>
<p>As to Dr. Lankester, all Woodbridge was scandalized when it
was announced that he was articled to a medical man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What, make a doctor of him!&rsquo; said the local gossips
at the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;They had much better make a butcher of
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And not a little were the good people
astonished when he came to town, and was signally successful as a
medical lecturer, and as an advocate of the sanitary principles
which in our day have come to be recognised as essential to the
welfare of the State.&nbsp; Dr. Lankester was in great request as
a writer on medical subjects in a popular manner, and did
undoubtedly much good in his day.&nbsp; A good many genteel
people lived in the neighbourhood of Woodbridge, and it had a
society to which it can lay no claim at the present time.&nbsp;
Edward Fitzgerald, the friend of Thackeray and Carlyle, himself
an author of no mean repute, lived close by.</p>
<p>That genteel people should have pitched their <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>tents in or around Woodbridge is not much to be
wondered at, as the neighbourhood was certainly attractive and
convenient at the same time.&nbsp; The scenery around is as
interesting as any that could be found, at any rate, in that part
of England.&nbsp; The drive from Tuddenham to Woodbridge, says
Mr. Taylor, in his &lsquo;Ipswich Handbook,&rsquo; is perhaps
unequalled in Suffolk.&nbsp; On the road you pass through the
villages of Little and Great Bealings, and if you are on the
look-out for spots which an artist would love to study, you may
make a very short detour to Playford.&nbsp; The churches, both of
Little and of Great Bealings, are very ancient, and well deserve
a visit; but the Woodbridge Road itself passes through some very
pretty scenery.&nbsp; Rushmere Heath, in the early summer time,
when the gorse is in bloom, is one mass of yellow, in the cleared
spaces of which may usually be seen a gipsy encampment.&nbsp; The
gibbet once stood on this heath, and in former times it seems to
have been the place where executions usually took place.&nbsp; It
was here that in 1783 a woman, named Bedingfield, was burnt for
murdering her husband.&nbsp; In the early part of this century,
when there were many alarms as to a French invasion, and it was
the firm belief of the old ladies that one fine morning <!-- page
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>Bony would land upon our shores, and carry them all
away captive, many were the reviews of soldiers held there by the
Duke of Cambridge&mdash;whose house has been pointed out to me at
Woodbridge&mdash;and the Duke of Kent.&nbsp; At that time it was
the fashion to exercise the volunteers on a Sunday, a practice
which would not be sanctioned in our more religious age.&nbsp; It
is a beautiful ride through Kesgrave.&nbsp; Dense plantations
abound on both sides, and in May the chorus of nightingales is
described as something wonderful.&nbsp; In the word
&lsquo;Kesgrave&rsquo; we have an allusion to the barrows or
tumuli to be seen on Kesgrave Heath.&nbsp; There are several of
these erections remaining to this day, and perhaps tradition is
warranted in speaking of the spot as the site whereon the Danes
and Saxons met in deadly fight.&nbsp; It is certain that the
former frequently came up the Deben and the Orwell.&nbsp; At
Martlesham you see a creek, richly wooded on both sides, which
flows up from the River Deben.&nbsp; It is a striking object at
high water, but by no means so striking as the sign of the
village public-house&mdash;the head of a huge wooden lion painted
with the brightest of reds.&nbsp; It was originally the
figure-head of a Dutch man-of-war, one of the fleet defeated at
the famous battle of Sole Bay.&nbsp; Be <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>that as it
may, no sign is better known than that of Martlesham Red
Lion.&nbsp; &lsquo;As red as Martlesham Lion&rsquo; is still a
common figure of speech throughout East Suffolk, and I am glad to
see that in the beautiful East Anglian etchings of Mr. Edwards, a
Suffolk lawyer, who turned artist, Martlesham Red Lion has
justice done to it at last.</p>
<p>Woodbridge, which the guide-book in 1844 described as a
thriving town and port&mdash;I question whether it is thriving
now&mdash;is situated on the western bank of the Deben, about
nine miles above the mouth of the river, and about eight miles to
the north of Ipswich.&nbsp; In Domesday Book the place is called
Udebridge, of which its present name is no doubt a
corruption.&nbsp; Mr. William White, whom I have already quoted,
says: &lsquo;Fifty years ago only one daily coach and a weekly
waggon passed through the town to and from London; but more than
twelve conveyances (coaches, omnibuses and carriers&rsquo;
waggons) now pass daily between the hours of six in the morning
and twelve at noon, and persons may travel from Woodbridge to
London in a few hours for ten shillings, instead of paying three
times that amount, and being thirteen hours on the road, as was
formerly the case.&rsquo;&nbsp; The railway has now rendered <!--
page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>it possible for people to travel at a quicker speed and
at a cheaper rate.&nbsp; In London we have a Woodbridge Street,
in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell Green, which points to a
connection between the poorer part of the City and the
picturesque Suffolk town on the banks of the Deben, and this
gives me occasion to speak of Thomas Seckford, Esq., one of the
masters of the Court of Requests, and Surveyor of the Court of
Wards and Liveries in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; He was
not less distinguished in the profession of the law than in the
other polite accomplishments of the age in which he lived, and to
his patronage of his servant, Christopher Saxton, the public were
indebted for the first set of county maps, which were engraved by
his encouragement and at his request.&nbsp; He represented
Ipswich in three Parliaments, and died without issue in 1588,
aged seventy-two.&nbsp; In Woodbridge his name is perpetuated by
a handsome pile of buildings known as the Seckford Almshouses and
Schools, to which the property in Clerkenwell is devoted.&nbsp;
At the time of his decease that property produced about
&pound;112 a year; in 1768 it was said to be of the yearly value
of &pound;563.&nbsp; In 1826 an Act of Parliament was obtained to
enable the governors of the almshouses to grant building and <!--
page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>other leases, to take down many of the old buildings,
to erect new premises, and repair and alter old ones, and to lay
out new streets on the charity estate in Clerkenwell, and, in
consequence, we find in 1830 the estate producing a rental of
more than &pound;3,000 a year.&nbsp; In 1844 the yearly rental
had risen to &pound;4,000.&nbsp; Since then it has much
increased, and all this is devoted to the benefit of the
Woodbridge poor.</p>
<p>In 1806 Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet, came to live at
Woodbridge.&nbsp; When fourteen years old he was apprenticed to
Mr. Samuel Jessup, a shopkeeper in Halstead, Essex.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There I stood,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;for eight years
behind the counter of the corner shop at the top of Halstead
Hill, kept to this day (November 9, 1828) by my old master and
still worthy uncle, S. Jessup.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Woodbridge he
married a niece of his old master, and went into partnership with
her brother as corn and coal merchant.&nbsp; But she died in
giving birth to the Lucy Barton whose name still, unless I am
mistaken, adorns our literature.&nbsp; Bernard gave up business
and retired into the bank of the Messrs. Alexander, where he
continued for forty years, working within two days of his
death.&nbsp; He had always been fond of books, and was one of the
<!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>most active members of a Woodbridge Book Club, and had
been in the habit of writing and sending to his friends
occasional copies of verse.&nbsp; In 1812 he published his first
volume, called &lsquo;Metrical Effusions,&rsquo; and began a
correspondence with Southey.&nbsp; A complimentary copy of verses
which he had addressed to the author of the &lsquo;Queen&rsquo;s
Wake,&rsquo; just then come into notice, brought him long and
vehement letters from the Ettrick&mdash;letters full of thanks to
Barton and praises of himself, and a tragedy &lsquo;that will
astonish the world ten times more than the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
Wake,&rdquo;&rsquo; to which justice could not be done in
Edinburgh, and which Bernard Barton was to try to get represented
in London.&nbsp; In 1825 one of Bernard&rsquo;s volumes of poems
had run into a fifth edition, and of another George IV. had
accepted the dedication.&nbsp; Thus prompted to exertion, he
worked too hard; banking all day and writing poetry all night
were too much for him.&nbsp; Lamb, however, cheered up the
dyspeptic poet.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are too much apprehensive about
your complaint,&rsquo; he wrote.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know many that
are always writing of it and live on to a good old age.&nbsp; I
knew a merry fellow&mdash;you partly know him, too&mdash;who,
when his medical adviser told him he had drunk all <i>that
part</i>, congratulated <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>himself,
now his liver was gone, that he should be the longest liver of
the two.&rsquo;&nbsp; Southey wrote in a soberer vein.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My friend, go to bed early; and if you eat suppers, read
afterwards, but never compose, that you may lie down with a quiet
intellect.&nbsp; There is an intellectual as well as a religious
peace of mind, and without the former be assured there can be no
health for a poet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At times Bernard Barton seems to have been troubled about
money matters.&nbsp; On one occasion he appears to have made up
his mind to have done with banking and devote himself to
literature.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep to your bank,&rsquo; wrote Lamb,
&lsquo;and the bank will keep you.&nbsp; Trust not to the public:
you may hang, starve, drown yourself, for anything that worthy
personage cares.&nbsp; I bless every star that Providence, not
seeing good to make me independent, has seen it next good to
settle me on the stable foundation of Leadenhall.&nbsp; Sit down,
good B. B., in the banking office.&nbsp; What! is there not from
six to eleven p.m. six days in the week? and is there not all
Sunday?&rsquo;&nbsp; Fortunately for B. B., friends came to his
rescue.&nbsp; A few members of his Society, including some of the
wealthier of his own family, raised among them &pound;1,200 for
his benefit.&nbsp; The scheme originated with Joseph John Gurney,
<!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>of Norwich, and in 1824 when the money was collected,
it was felt that &pound;1,200 was a great deal for a poet to
receive.&nbsp; Bernard Barton&rsquo;s daughter married a Suffolk
gentleman, well-to-do in the world, but the lady and gentleman
had not congenial minds, and parted almost as soon as the
honeymoon was over.</p>
<p>B. B. was a great correspondent.&nbsp; As a banker&rsquo;s
clerk, necessarily his journeys were few and far between.&nbsp;
Once or twice he visited Charles Lamb.&nbsp; He once also met
Southey at Thomas Clarkson&rsquo;s, at Playford Hall, perhaps the
most picturesque old house in East Anglia, where the latter
resided, and of which I have a distinct recollection, as, on the
terrace before the moat with which it was surrounded, I once saw
the venerable philanthropist and his grandchildren.&nbsp; Now and
then B. B. also visited the Rev. Mr. Mitford at Benhall, a
village between Woodbridge and Saxmundham, who was then engaged
in editing the Aldine edition of the English Poets.&nbsp; But B.
B.&rsquo;s correspondents were numerous.&nbsp; Poor, unfortunate
L. E. L. sent him girlish letters.&nbsp; Mrs. Hemans was also a
correspondent, as were the Howitts and Mrs. Opie and Dr. Drake,
of Hadley, whose literary disquisitions are now, alas! forgotten;
and poor Charles Lloyd, <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>whose
father wrote of his son&rsquo;s many books &lsquo;that it is
easier to write them than to gain numerous readers.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Dr. Bowring and Josiah Conder were also on writing terms with the
Quaker poet.&nbsp; His excursions, his daughter tells us, rarely
extended beyond a few miles round Woodbridge, to the vale of
Dedham, Constable&rsquo;s birthplace and painting-room; or to the
neighbouring seacoast, including Aldborough, doubly dear to him
from its association with the memory and poetry of Crabbe.&nbsp;
Once upon a time he dined with Sir Robert Peel, when he had the
pleasure of meeting Airy, the late Astronomer Royal, whom he had
known as a lad at Playford.&nbsp; The dinner with Sir Robert Peel
ended satisfactorily, as it resulted in the bestowal by the Queen
on the poet of a pension of &pound;100 a year.&nbsp; He was now
beyond the fear of being tempted to commit forgery, and being
hung in consequence&mdash;a possibility, which was the occasion
of one of Lamb&rsquo;s wittiest letters.&nbsp; The gentle Elia
made merry over the chance of a Quaker poet being hung.</p>
<p>Amiable and liberal as was Bernard Barton, he could and did
strike hard when occasion required.&nbsp; In East Anglia, when I
was a lad, there was a great deal of intolerance&mdash;almost as
much as exists in society circles at the present day&mdash;and
<!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>that is saying a great deal.&nbsp; Churchmen, in their
ignorance, were ready to put down Dissent in every way, and
occasionally, by their absurdity, they roused the righteous ire
of the Quaker poet.&nbsp; One of them, for instance, had said at
a public meeting: &lsquo;This was the opinion he had formed of
Dissenters, that they were wolves in sheep&rsquo;s
clothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon B. B. wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing! bitter
words and big;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But who applies them? first the speaker scan;<br />
A suckling Tory! an apostate Whig!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed a very silly, weak young man!</p>
<p>&lsquo;What such an one may either think or say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sober people matters not one pin;<br />
In <i>their</i> opinion his own senseless bray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proves <i>him</i> the <span class="smcap">ass wrapt
in a lion&rsquo;s skin</span>!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better is the following address to a certain Dr. E.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A bullying, brawling, champion of the
Church,<br />
Vain as a parrot screaming on her perch;<br />
And like that parrot screaming out by rote,<br />
The same stale, flat, unprofitable note;<br />
Still interrupting all debate<br />
With one eternal cry of &ldquo;Church and State!&rdquo;<br />
With all the High Tory&rsquo;s ignorance increased,<br />
By all the arrogance that makes the priest;<br />
One who declares upon his solemn word<br />
The Voluntary system is absurd;<br />
He well may say so, for &rsquo;twere hard to tell<br />
Who would support him did not law compel.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>A prophet, it is said, is not honoured in his own
country.&nbsp; Bernard Barton was happily the rare exception that
proves the rule.&nbsp; I remember being at the launching of a
vessel, bought and owned by a Woodbridge man, called the
<i>Bernard Barton</i>; it was the first time I had ever seen a
ship launched, and I was interested accordingly.&nbsp; The
ultimate fate of the craft is unknown to history.&nbsp; On one
occasion she was reported in the shipping list amongst the
arrivals at some far-off port as the <i>Barney Burton</i>.&nbsp;
Such is fame!</p>
<p>Of his local reputation Bernard was not a little proud.&nbsp;
His little town was vain of him.&nbsp; It was something to go
into the bank and get a cheque cashed by the poet.&nbsp; The
other evening I went to the house of a Woodbridge man who has
done well in London, and lives in one of the few grand old houses
which yet adorn Stoke Newington Green&mdash;just a stone&rsquo;s
throw from where Samuel Rogers dwelt&mdash;and there in the
drawing-room were Bernard Barton&rsquo;s own chair and cabinet
preserved with as much pious care as if he had been a Shakespeare
or a Milton.&nbsp; Bernard Barton made no secret of his vocation,
and when the time had come that he had delivered himself of a new
poem, it was his habit to call on one or other of his friends and
<!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>discuss the matter over a bottle of port&mdash;port
befitting the occasion; no modern liquor of that name&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Not
such as that<br />
You set before chance comers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But such whose father grape grew fat<br />
On Lusitanian summers.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there was a good deal of talk, as was to be expected,
on things in general, for B. B. loved his joke and was full of
anecdote&mdash;anecdote, perhaps, not always of the most refined
character.&nbsp; But what could you expect at such happy times
from a man brimful of human nature, who had to pose all life
under the double weight of decorum imposed on him, in the first
place as a Quaker, and in the second place as a banker&rsquo;s
clerk?</p>
<p>Bernard Barton, as I recollect him, was somewhat of a dear old
man&mdash;short in person, red in face, with dark brown
hair.&nbsp; He was, as I have said, a clerk in a bank, but his
poetry had elevated him, somehow, to the rank of a provincial
lion, and at certain houses, where the dinner was good and the
wine was ditto, he ever was a welcome guest.&nbsp; I dined with
him at the house of a friend in Woodbridge, and it seemed to me
that he cared more for good feeding and a glass of wine and a
<!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>pinch of snuff than the sacred Nine.&nbsp; Of course at
that time I had not been educated up to the fitting state of mind
with which the philosopher of our day proceeds to the performance
of the mysteries of dinner.&nbsp; Dining had at that time not
been elevated to the rank of a science, to the study of which the
most acute intellects devote their highest energies; nor had
flowers then been invoked to lend an additional grace to the
dining-table.&nbsp; Besides, dinners such as Mr. Black gives at
Brighton, scientific dinners, such as those feasts with which Sir
Henry Thompson regales his friends, were unknown.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, now and then we managed to dine comfortably off
roast beef or lamb, a slice of boiled or roast fowl, a bit of
plum-pudding or fruit tart, a crust of bread and cheese,
with&mdash;tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of
Askalon&mdash;sherry and Madeira at dinner, and a few glasses of
fine old fruity port after.&nbsp; Some Shakespearian
quotations&mdash;unknown to me then, for Shakespeare was little
quoted in purely evangelical circles, either in Church or
Dissent&mdash;a reference to Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s earlier
German translations, formed about the sum and substance of the
conversation which took place between the poet and my host; all
the rest was <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>principally social gossip and an
exchange of pleasantries between the poet and his friend, whom he
addressed familiarly as &lsquo;mine ancient.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
a great treat to me, of course, to dine with Bernard Barton, the
Quaker poet.&nbsp; Once upon a time a Quaker minister had come to
Woodbridge on a preaching tour, and all the Quakers, male and
female, small and great, rich and poor, were ranged before
him.&nbsp; When Bernard Barton was announced, the good old man
said, &lsquo;Barton&mdash;Barton&mdash;that&rsquo;s a name I
don&rsquo;t recollect.&rsquo;&nbsp; The bearer of the name
replied it would be strange if he did, seeing that they had never
met before.&nbsp; Suddenly looking up, the minister exclaimed,
&lsquo;Art thou the versifying man?&rsquo;&nbsp; Unlike the
venerable stranger, I had no need to ask the question, as in my
mother&rsquo;s album there was more than one letter from the
genial B. B.</p>
<p>I can well recall the room in which I dined with the
poet.&nbsp; My host had come into a handsome fortune by marrying
a wealthy widow&mdash;one of the possibilities of a Dissenting
minister&rsquo;s situation&mdash;and he had retired from the
ministry to cultivate literature and literary men.&nbsp; As I
think of that room and that dinner, I am reminded of the
wonderful contrast effected within the last age.&nbsp; <!-- page
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>At
that time the dinner-table presented a far less picturesque
appearance than it does now.&nbsp; We had always pudding before
meat; the latter was solid, and in the shape of a joint.&nbsp;
Nor was it handed round by servants, but carved by the host or
his lady.&nbsp; Silver forks were unknown, and electro-plate had
not then been invented.&nbsp; Vegetables, also, were deficient as
regards quantity and quality compared with the supply at a
respectable dinner nowadays.&nbsp; In manners the change is
equally remarkable.&nbsp; It was said of a nobleman, a personal
friend of George III., and a model gentleman of his day, that he
had made the tour of Europe without ever touching the back of his
travelling carriage.&nbsp; That includes an idea of self-denial
utterly unknown to all the young people of to-day.&nbsp; The
study now is how to make our houses more comfortable, and to
furnish them most luxuriously.&nbsp; Then, perhaps, there was but
one sofa in the house, and that was repellent rather than
attractive.&nbsp; Easy-chairs were few and far between.&nbsp;
Lounging of any kind was out of the question.&nbsp; In the
drawing-room, the furniture was of the same uncomfortable
description, and there were none of the modern appliances which
exist to make ladies and gentlemen happy.&nbsp; Couches, <!--
page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>antimacassars, photographs, were unknown.&nbsp; One
picture invariably to be seen was a painting of a favourite
steed, with the owner looking at it in a state of intense
admiration; and a few family portraits might be ostentatiously
displayed.&nbsp; As to pianos, there never was but one in the
house; and a billiard-table would have been considered as the
last refuge of human depravity.&nbsp; In sitting-rooms and
bedrooms and passages there was a great deficiency of carpets and
of oilcloth.&nbsp; But furniture was furniture then, and could
stand a good deal of wear and tear; while as to the spare bed in
the best room, with its enormous four posts and its gigantic
funereal canopy and its heavy curtains, through which no breath
of fresh air could penetrate, all I can say is that people slept
in it and survived the operation&mdash;so wonderfully does nature
adapt itself to circumstances the most adverse.</p>
<p>This reference to Bernard Barton reminds me of a portrait he
has left in one of his pleasant letters of a Suffolk yeoman, a
class of whose virtues I can testify from personal
experience.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a hearty old yeoman of
eighty-six, and had occupied the farm in which he lived and died
about fifty-five years.&nbsp; Social, hospitable, friendly, a
liberal master to his labourers, a kind neighbour, and a right
merry <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>companion within the limits of
becoming mirth.&nbsp; In politics a stanch Whig, in his
theological creed as sturdy a Dissenter; yet with no more party
spirit in him than a child.&nbsp; He and I belonged to the same
book-club for about forty years. . . . Not that he greatly cared
about books or was deeply read in them, but he loved to meet his
neighbours and get them round him on any occasion or no occasion
at all.&nbsp; As a fine specimen of the true English yeoman, I
have met with few to equal, if any to surpass him, and he looked
the character as well as he acted it, till within a few years,
when the strong man was bowed by bodily infirmity.&nbsp; About
twenty-six years ago, in his dress costume of a blue coat and
yellow buckskins, a finer sample of John Bullism you would rarely
see.&nbsp; It was the whole study of his long life to make the
few who revolved round him in his little orbit as happy as he
seemed to be himself.&nbsp; Yet I was gravely queried when I
happened to say that his children had asked me to write a few
lines to his memory, whether I could do this in keeping with the
general tone of my poetry&mdash;the speaker doubted if he was a
decidedly pious character!&nbsp; He had at times in his altitude
been known to vociferate a song, of which the chorus was
certainly not teetotalism:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sing old Rose, and
burn the bellows,<br />
Drink and drive dull care away.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bernard Barton goes on to describe the deceased yeoman as a
diligent attendant at the meeting-house, a frequent and serious
reader of the Bible, and the head of an orderly and
well-regulated house.&nbsp; He is described as knowing Dr.
Watts&rsquo; hymns almost by heart, and as singing them on Sunday
at meeting with equal fervour and unction.&nbsp; Bernard Barton
feared in 1847&mdash;the date of his epistle&mdash;the breed of
such men was dying out.&nbsp; It is to be feared in East Anglia
the race is quite extinct.&nbsp; In our meeting-house at
Wrentham, when I was a lad, there were several such.&nbsp; I am
afraid there is not one there now.&nbsp; The sons and daughters
have left the old rustic houses, and gone out into the
world.&nbsp; They have become respectable, and go to church, and
have lost a good deal of the vigour and independence of their
forefathers.&nbsp; In all the East Anglian meeting-houses fifty
years ago such men abounded.&nbsp; Of a Sunday, with their blue
coats and kerseymere knee-breeches, and jolly red laces, they
looked more like country squires than common farmers.&nbsp; They
drove up to the meeting-house yard with very superior gigs and
cattle.&nbsp; In their houses creature comforts of all known
kinds <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>were to be found.&nbsp; Tea&mdash;a
hearty meal, not of mere bread-and-butter, but of ham and cake as
well&mdash;was served up in the parlour, with a glass or two of
real home-brewed ale, amber-coloured, of a quality now unknown,
and which was wonderfully refreshing after a long walk or
drive.&nbsp; Then, if it were summer, there was a stroll in the
big garden, well planted with fruit-trees and strawberry-beds,
and adorned with flowers&mdash;old-fashioned, perhaps, but rich,
nevertheless, in colour and perfume.&nbsp; In one corner there
was sure to be an arbour, all covered with honeysuckle, such as
Izaak Walton himself would have approved; and there, while the
seniors over their long pipes discussed politics and theology,
and corn and cattle, the younger ones would make their first
feeble efforts, all unconsciously, perhaps, to conjugate the verb
&lsquo;to love.&rsquo;&nbsp; Outside the church organizations
these old yeomen lived and died.&nbsp; There was a flavour of the
world about them.&nbsp; They would dine at market ordinaries, and
perhaps would stop an hour in the long room of the public-house,
where they put up their horses, to smoke a pipe and take a drop
of brandy-and-water for the good of the landlord.&nbsp; Now and
then&mdash;sometimes to the sorrow of their wives, who were often
church-members&mdash;they would join, as I have indicated, in
<!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>a song of an objectionable character when severely
criticised.&nbsp; Perhaps their parson would be much exercised on
their behalf; but surely the noble spirit of humanity in these
old yeomen, at any rate, was as worthy of admiration as the
Puritanic faith of the past&mdash;or as the honest doubt of the
present age.&nbsp; If I mistake not, the fine old yeoman to whom
Bernard Barton referred lived not far from Seckford Hall.</p>
<p>Woodbridge has some claim to consideration from the
Nonconformist point of view.&nbsp; In 1648 a schoolmistress,
Elizabeth Warren, published a pamphlet, &lsquo;The Old and Good
Way Vindicated, in a Treatise, wherein Divers Errours, both in
Judgment and Practice incident to these Declining Days, are
Unmasked for the Caution of humble Christians.&rsquo;&nbsp; From
the same town also there issued &lsquo;The Preacher Sent: a
Vindication of the Liberty of Public Preaching by Some Men not
Ordained.&rsquo;&nbsp; The author of this book, or one of the
authors of it, was the Rev. Frederick Woodall, the first pastor
of the Free Church&mdash;&lsquo;a man of learning, ability, and
piety, a strict Independent, zealous for the fifth monarchy, and
a considerable sufferer after his ejectment.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had,
we are told, to contend with a tedious embarrassment, through the
persecuting <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>spirit that for many years
prevailed, and considerably cramped the success of his
ministry.&nbsp; Woodbridge is one of the churches which Mr.
Harmer refers to in his &lsquo;Miscellaneous Works,&rsquo; as
being rigidly Congregationalist, and which conducted its affairs
rather according to the heads of Savoy Confession than the heads
of Agreement.&nbsp; When I was a boy the pastor was a Mr.
Pinchback, who seems to have been a worthy successor of godly
men, equally attractive and successful.&nbsp; He had previously
settled at Ware.&nbsp; It is recorded of the good divine that on
one occasion he had to leave his wife at the point of death, as
it seemed, to go to chapel.&nbsp; In the course of the service he
mentioned the fact of her illness, and announced in consequence
that he would preach her funeral sermon on the following
Sunday.&nbsp; But when the following Sunday came the lady was
better, and lived for many years to assist her husband in his
godly work.&nbsp; In the rural districts the Baptists flourished
immensely.</p>
<p>At Grundisburgh there preached for many years to a large
congregation a worthy man of the name of Collins, who was one of
the leading lights of the body which rejoiced in a John Foreman
and a Brother Wells.&nbsp; People who live in London cannot <!--
page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>have forgotten Jemmy Wells, of the Surrey Tabernacle,
and his grotesque and telling anecdotes.&nbsp; One can scarcely
imagine how people could ever believe the things Wells used to
say as to the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with him; but they did, and
his funeral&mdash;in South London, at any rate&mdash;was almost
as numerously attended as that of Arthur, Duke of
Wellington.&nbsp; I expect high-and-dry Baptists have been not a
little troublesome in their day, and in East Anglia they were
more numerous than in London.&nbsp; It may be that they have
helped to weaken Dissent in that part of the world.&nbsp; Men of
independent intellect must have been not a little shocked by that
unctuous familiarity with God and the devil which is the
characteristic of that class.&nbsp; On a Sunday morning Jemmy
Wells, as his admirers called him, would describe in the most
graphic manner what the devil had said to him in the course of
the week; and on one memorable occasion, at any rate, described
with much force the shame he felt at having to tell the gentleman
in black that his people&rsquo;s memories, unfortunately, were
somewhat remiss in the matter of pew-rents.&nbsp; Brother Collins
avoided such flights, but he was an attractive preacher to all
the country round, nevertheless.&nbsp; Truly such a one was
needed in that <!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>district.&nbsp; At Rendham, a
village near Saxmundham, lived a godly minister of the Church of
England.&nbsp; In 1844, speaking to a friend of the writer, he
said that when he came into the county, between thirty and forty
years before, there was only one other clergyman and himself
between Ipswich and Great Yarmouth who preached the Gospel, and
that sometimes the squire of the parish would hold up his watch
to him to bid him close his sermon.&nbsp; In some places where he
went to preach he had to have a body-guard to prevent his being
mobbed and pelted with rotten eggs on account of his evangelical
principles.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Stowmarket&mdash;The Rev. Thomas
Young&mdash;Bishop Hall and the Smectymnian
divines&mdash;Milton&rsquo;s mulberry-tree&mdash;Suffolk
relationships.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father destined me,&rsquo; writes John Milton, in
his &lsquo;Defensio Secunda,&rsquo; &lsquo;while yet a little
boy, for the study of humane letters, which I served with such
eagerness that, from the twelfth year of my age, I scarcely ever
went from my lessons to bed before midnight, which, indeed, was
the first cause of injury to my eyes, to whose natural weakness
there were also added frequent headaches; all which not retarding
my natural impetuosity in learning, he caused me to be instructed
both at the Grammar School and under other masters at
home.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of the latter, the best known was the Rev.
Thomas Young, the Puritan minister, of Stowmarket, Suffolk.</p>
<p>It is generally claimed for Young that he was <!-- page
284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>an
East Anglian.&nbsp; Professor Masson has, however, settled the
question that he was a Scotchman, of the University of
Aberdeen.&nbsp; Be that as it may, like most Scotchmen, he made
his way to England, and was employed by Mr. Milton, the scrivener
of Bread Street, to teach his gifted son.&nbsp; As he seems to
have been married at the time, it is not probable that he resided
with his pupil, but only visited him daily.&nbsp; Never had
master a better pupil, or one who rewarded him more richly by the
splendour of his subsequent career.&nbsp; The poet, writing to
him a few years after he ceased to be his pupil, speaks of
&lsquo;the incredible and singular gratitude he owed him on
account of the services he had done him,&rsquo; and calls God to
witness that he reverenced him as his father.&nbsp; In a Latin
elegy, after implying that Young was dearer to him than Socrates
to Alcibiades, or than the great Stagyrite to his generous pupil,
Alexander, he goes on to say: &lsquo;First, under his guidance, I
explored the recesses of the Muses, and beheld the sacred green
spots of the cleft summit of Parnassus and quaffed the Pierian
cups, and, Clio favouring me, thrice sprinkled my joyful mouth
with Castalian wine;&rsquo; from which it is clear that Young had
done his duty to his pupil, and that the latter ever regarded
<!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>him with an affection as beautiful as rare.&nbsp; Never
did a Rugby lad write of Arnold as Milton of Thomas Young.&nbsp;
How long the latter&rsquo;s preceptorship lasted cannot be
determined with precision.&nbsp; &lsquo;It certainly
closed,&rsquo; writes Professor Masson, in that truly awful
biography of his, &lsquo;when Young left England at the age of
thirty-five, and became pastor of the congregation of British
merchants settled at Hamburg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As one of the leaders of the Presbyterian party, Dr. Thomas
Young became Vicar of Stowmarket in due time.&nbsp; He was one of
the Smectymnian divines.&nbsp; As it is not every schoolboy who
knows what the term means, let me explain who they were.&nbsp;
Two or three hundred years ago people were much more
controversial than they are now, and very fierce was the battle
on the subject of the relative claims, from a Scriptural point of
view, of Prelacy or Presbytery.&nbsp; One of the most
distinguished champions of the former was Dr. Hall, Bishop of
Norwich&mdash;a simple, godly, learned man, who deserves to be
held in remembrance, if only for the way in which he got
married.&nbsp; &lsquo;Being now settled,&rsquo; he writes,
&lsquo;in that sweet and civil county of Suffolk, the uncouth
solitariness of my life, and the extreme incommodity of that
single housekeeping, drew my <!-- page 286--><a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>thoughts,
after two years, to condescend to the necessity of a married
state, which God no less strangely provided for me; for walking
from the church on Monday, in the Whitsun week, with a grave and
reverend minister, I saw a comely and modest gentlewoman standing
at the door of that house where we were invited to a
wedding-dinner, and inquiring of that worthy friend whether he
knew her, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;I know her well,
and have bespoken her for your wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I further
demanded an account of that answer, he told me she was the
daughter of a gentleman whom he much respected&mdash;Mr. George
Whinniff, of Brettenham; that out of an opinion he had of the
fitness of that match for me he had already treated with her
father about it, whom he found very apt to entertain it.&nbsp;
Advising me not to neglect the opportunity, and not concealing
the just praises of the modesty, piety, good disposition, and
other virtues that were lodged in that seemly presence, I
listened to the motion as sent from God, and at last, upon due
prosecution, happily prevailed, enjoying the comfortable society
of that meet-help for the space of forty-nine years.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A young clergyman so good and amiable ought to have fared better
as regards the days in which his lot was passed.&nbsp; Hall <!--
page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>should have lived in some theological Arcadia.&nbsp; As
it was, he had to fight much and suffer much.&nbsp; In those
distracted times he was all for peace.&nbsp; When the storm was
brewing in Church and State, which for a time swept away Bishop
and King, he published&mdash;but, alas! in vain&mdash;his
&lsquo;Via Media.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; he wrote,
&lsquo;every man to rank himself unto a side, and to draw in the
quarrel he affecteth.&nbsp; I see no man either holding or
joining their hands for peace.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bishop Hall was the
most celebrated writer of his time in defence of the Church of
England.&nbsp; Archbishop Laud got him to write on &lsquo;The
Divine Right of Episcopacy,&rsquo; nor could he have well placed
the subject in abler hands.&nbsp; This was followed, after Laud
had fallen, with &lsquo;An Humble Remonstrance to the High Court
of Parliament,&rsquo; in which treatise he vindicated the
antiquity of liturgies and Episcopacy with admirable skill,
meekness, and simplicity, yet with such strength of argument that
five Presbyterian divines clubbed their wits together to frame an
answer.&nbsp; These Presbyterian ministers were&mdash;Stephen
Marshal, then lecturer at St. Margaret&rsquo;s, whom Baillie
terms the best of the preachers in England; Edmund Calamy, who
had long been a celebrated East Anglian preacher, first at
Swaffham, then at Bury <!-- page 288--><a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>St.
Edmunds, who, as we all know, refused a bishopric when offered
him, and whom, therefore, at any rate, his adversaries must allow
to have been sincere; Thomas Young, Matthew Newcomen, and William
Spurstow.&nbsp; To this reply was given the name of
Smectymnuus&mdash;a startling word, as Calamy calls it, made up
of the initial letters of these names.&nbsp; This work, which was
published in 1641, gave, says Dr. M&rsquo;Crie, the first serious
blow to Prelacy.&nbsp; It was composed in a style superior to
that of the Puritans in general, and was, by the confession of
the learned Bishop Wilkins, a capital work against
Episcopacy.&nbsp; Dr. Kippis says, &lsquo;This piece is certainly
written with great fierceness and asperity of language,&rsquo;
and quotes, as evidence, some strong things said against the
practice of the prelates.&nbsp; But Neal, who has given a long
account of the work, states that, if the rest of the clergy had
been of the same temper and spirit with Bishop Hall, the
controversy between him and the Smectymnian divines might have
been compromised.</p>
<p>Stowmarket, as I have said, had the honour of being placed
under the pastoral care of one of these Smectymnian
divines.&nbsp; He came there in March, 1628, on the presentation
of Mr. John <!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>Howe, a gentleman then residing in
the town, and a man of wealth, whose ancestors had been great
cloth-manufacturers in that place and neighbourhood.&nbsp; Since
the time of Edward III. the cloth manufacture had been very
active in Suffolk, and it is little to the credit of its
merchants that we find them, in 1522, petitioning for the repeal
of a royal law which inflicted a penalty against those who sold
cloth which, when wetted, shrunk up, on the plea that, as such
goods were made for a foreign market, the home-consumer was not
injured.&nbsp; Stowmarket, when I was a lad, had reached its
climax in a pecuniary sense.&nbsp; In the early part of the
present century it was spoken of as a rising town.&nbsp; Situated
as it was in the centre of the county, it was a convenient mart
for barley, and great quantities of malt were made.&nbsp; Its
other manufactures were sacking, ropes, and twine.&nbsp; Its
tanneries were of a more recent date, as also its manufactory of
gun-cotton, connected with which at one time there was an
explosion of a most fatal and disastrous character.&nbsp; In 1763
it was connected with Ipswich by means of a canal, which was a
great source of prosperity to the town.&nbsp; Up to the time of
the great Reform Bill, it was the great place for county
meetings, and for the nomination of the county
representatives.&nbsp; In our <!-- page 290--><a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>day it has
a population of 4,052.&nbsp; When I was a lad it was one of the
first towns to welcome the Plymouth Brethren into Suffolk, and
they are there still.&nbsp; The Independent Chapel for awhile
suffered much from them.&nbsp; The pastor was a very worthy but
somewhat dry preacher.&nbsp; His favourite quotation in the
pulpit, when he would describe the attacks of the enemy of God
and man, was</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He worries whom he can&rsquo;t devour<br />
With a malicious joy.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suffolk had its great lawyers as well as Norfolk.&nbsp; The
first to head the list is Ranulph de Glanville, a man of great
parts, deep learning, for the times, eminent alike for his legal
abilities and energetic mind.&nbsp; He was said, by one account,
to have been born at Stowmarket.&nbsp; It is certain he founded
Leiston Abbey, near Aldborough, and Bentley Priory.&nbsp; As
Chief Justice under Henry II. he naturally was no favourite with
Richard I., who deprived him of his office and made use of his
wealth.&nbsp; He lived, however, to accompany Richard to the Holy
Land, and died at the siege of Acre.&nbsp; His treatise on our
laws is one of the earliest on record.&nbsp; It must be
remembered also that Godwin, the author of &lsquo;Political
Justice,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Caleb Williams,&rsquo; a novel still
read&mdash;the husband of one gifted <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>woman, and
the father of another&mdash;was at one time an Independent
minister at Stowmarket.</p>
<p>But to return to Dr. Young.&nbsp; He, like Mr. Newcomen, had
become an East Anglian, and Smectymnuus may therefore more or
less be said to have an East Anglian original.&nbsp; As the
living of Stowmarket was at that time worth &pound;300 a year,
and as &pound;300 a year then was quite equal to &pound;600 a
year now, Dr. Young must have been in comfortable circumstances
while at Stowmarket.&nbsp; A likeness of him is hung up, or was
preserved, in Stowmarket Vicarage.&nbsp; &lsquo;It,&rsquo; wrote
an old observer, &lsquo;possesses the solemn, faded yellowness of
a man much given to austere meditation, yet there is sufficient
energy in the eye and mouth to show, as he is preaching in Geneva
gown and bands, that he is a man who could write and think, and
speak with great vigour.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of Milton&rsquo;s
biographers terms him, contemptuously, a Puritan who cut his hair
short.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Hollingsworth writes that it is an
error to suppose that Young remained long as chaplain to
merchants abroad.&nbsp; &lsquo;He must have remained generally in
constant residence, because we possess his signature to the
vestry accounts, in a curious quarto book, which contains the
annual accounts of Stow upland Parish for eighty-four
years.&nbsp; At the parish meetings, <!-- page 292--><a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>and at the
audit of each year&rsquo;s accounts Vicar Young presided, with
some exceptions, from the year 1629 to 1655, and his autograph is
attached to each page.&rsquo;&nbsp; As an author, Dr. Young had
distinguished himself before he appeared as one of the
Smectymnians.&nbsp; In 1639, while the Stuarts and the Bishops
were doing all they could to break down the sanctity of the
Sabbath, and to make it a day of vulgar revelry and rustic sport,
Dr. Young published a thin quarto in Latin, entitled &lsquo;Dies
Dominica,&rsquo; containing a history of the institution of the
Sabbath, and its vindication from all common and profane
uses.&nbsp; There is no place of publication named, the signature
is feigned, &lsquo;Theophilus Philo Kunaces Loncardiensis,&rsquo;
and in the copy reserved at Stowmarket is added, in characters by
no means unlike that of the handwriting of the Vicar himself,
&lsquo;Dr. Thos. Young, of Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tractate is
described as a very elaborate and learned compilation from the
Fathers upon the sanctity of the Sabbath.&nbsp; A spirit of
laborious and determined energy pervades it, nor is it unworthy
the abilities and erudition of the author.&nbsp; The work was
written at Stowmarket, and may have been published in
Ipswich.&nbsp; Its paper and type are coarse; the name of the
author was concealed, because at that time <!-- page 293--><a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>a man who
reverenced the Sabbath had a good chance of being brought before
the Star Chamber, and of being roughly treated by Archbishop
Laud, as an enemy to Church and State.&nbsp; About ten years
before, Dr. Young had heard how, for writing his plea against
Prelacy, Dr. Alexander Leighton had been cast into Newgate,
dragged before the Star Chamber, where he was sentenced to have
his ears cut off, to have his nose slit, to be branded in the
face, to stand in the pillory, to be whipped at the post, to pay
a fine of &pound;10,000, and to suffer perpetual
imprisonment.&nbsp; Dr. Young might well shrink from exposing
himself to similar torture.&nbsp; But Dr. Young had other
warnings, and much nearer home.</p>
<p>Dr. Young, like most of the men of that time, persecuted
witches.&nbsp; These latter were supposed to have existed in
great numbers, and a roving commission for their discovery was
given to one Matthew Hopkins, of Manningtree, in Essex, to find
them out in the eastern counties and execute the law upon
them.&nbsp; It was a brutal business, and Hopkins followed it for
three or four years.&nbsp; He proceeded from town to town and
opened his courts.&nbsp; Stowmarket was one of the places he
visited.&nbsp; The Puritans are said to have hung sixty <!-- page
294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>witches in Suffolk, but the Puritans were not alone
responsible.&nbsp; It is a fact that, up to fifty years ago two
supposed witches lived in Stowmarket.</p>
<p>Dr. Young escaped the Star Chamber, but, like most good men
who would be free at that time he had to fly his native land for
awhile.&nbsp; Milton refers to this exile in his Latin elegy:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Meantime
alone<br />
Thou dwellest, and helpless on a soil unknown,<br />
Poor, and receiving from a foreign hand<br />
The aid denied thee in thy native land.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems from this that the living at Stowmarket was under
sequestration.&nbsp; A little while after Young is back in
Stowmarket, and Milton thus describes his daily life&mdash;a
personal experience of the poet&rsquo;s, not a flight of
fancy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Now, entering, thou shalt haply seated
see<br />
Besides his spouse, his infants on his knee;<br />
Or, turning page by page with studious look<br />
Some bulky paper or God&rsquo;s holy Book.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good times came to Dr. Young.&nbsp; The seed he had sown bore
fruit.&nbsp; For awhile England had woke up to attack the Stuart
doctrine of royal prerogative in Church and State.&nbsp; The men
of Suffolk had been the foremost in the fight, and in 1643 we
find the Doctor in Duke&rsquo;s Place, London.&nbsp; A sermon was
preached by him before <!-- page 295--><a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>the House
of Commons, and printed by order of the House.&nbsp; A Stowmarket
Rector speaks of it naturally as a very prolix, learned, somewhat
dull and heavy effort to encourage them to persevere in their
civil war against the King; but he has the grace to add:
&lsquo;There is much less of faction in it than many others, and
it is rather the production of a contemplative than of an active
partisan.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;One of his examples,&rsquo; writes
Mr. Hollingsworth, &lsquo;is from 2 Sam. xiii. 28, where the
command of Absalom was to kill Amnon: &ldquo;Could the command of
a <i>mortal man</i> infuse that courage and valour into the
hearts <i>of his servants</i> as to make them adventure upon a
<i>desperate</i> design?&nbsp; And shall not the command of the
<i>Almighty God</i> raise up the hearts of His people employed by
Him in any work to which <i>He</i> calls them, raise up their
hearts in following at His command!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Doctor had not cleared himself of all the errors of his
times.&nbsp; He urged on his hearers, by the example of the
Emperors, the necessity of maintaining the doctrine of the
Trinity uncorrupt, by the aid of the civil power.&nbsp; He urged,
however, on them personal holiness, in order that the reformation
of the Church might be more easily accomplished.&nbsp; The two
legislative enactments he wished them to pass <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>were to
confer a power upon the Presbyterian clergy to exclude men from
the Sacrament, and enforce a better observance of the
Sabbath-day.&nbsp; The sermon is scarce, but is bound up with
others in the Library at Cambridge, preached at the monthly fasts
before the House of Commons.</p>
<p>In the library of the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, where
assuredly the portrait of the Stowmarket Rector should find a
place, there is a copy of this sermon, which was preached at the
last solemn fast.&nbsp; February 28, 1643, with the notice that
&lsquo;It is this day ordered by the Commoners&rsquo; House of
Parliament that Sir John Trevor and Mr. Rous do from this House
give thanks to Mr. Young for the great paines hee tooke in the
sermon hee preached that day at the intreaty of the said House of
Commons at St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster, it being the day of
publike humiliation, and to desire him to print this
sermon;&rsquo; which accordingly was done, under the title of
&lsquo;Hope&rsquo;s Encouragement.&rsquo;&nbsp; The motto on the
outside was: &lsquo;Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul
both sure and steadfast, and entereth into that which is within
the veil.&rsquo;&nbsp; The sermon was printed in London for Ralph
Smith, at the sign of the Bible, in Cornhill, near the Royal
Exchange.&nbsp; In <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>his sermon the preacher took for his
text: &lsquo;Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your
heart, all ye that wait upon the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; The three
propositions established are: First, that God&rsquo;s people are
taught by the Lord in all their troubles to wait patiently on
Him.&nbsp; The second is that such as wait patiently upon the
Lord must rouse themselves with strength and courage to further
wait upon Him; and that, thirdly, when God&rsquo;s people wait
upon Him, He will increase their courage.&nbsp; The preacher
quotes the Hebrew and Augustine, and reasons in a most undeniable
manner in support of his propositions; but above all things he is
practical.&nbsp; &lsquo;The work you are now called on to
do,&rsquo; he says to the M.P.&rsquo;s, &lsquo;is a work of great
concernment.&nbsp; It is the purging of the Lord&rsquo;s
floor.&nbsp; As it hath reference both to the Church and the
Commonwealth, a work sure enough to be encountered with great
opposition.&nbsp; Yet I must say it is a work with the managing
whereof God hath not so honoured others which have gone before
you in your places, but hath reserved it to make you the
instruments of His glory in advancing it, and that doth much add
unto your honour.&nbsp; Was it an honour to the Tyrians that they
were counted amongst the builders of the Temple when Hiram sent
to <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>Solomon things necessary for that work?&nbsp; How,
then, hath God honoured you, reserving to you the care of
re-edifying His Church (the throne of the living God) and the
repairing of the shattered Commonwealth, so far borne down before
He raised you to support it, that succeeding ages may with honour
to your names, say, &ldquo;This was the Reforming
Parliament,&rdquo; a work which God, by His blessing on your
unwearied pains, hath much furthered already, whilst He, by you,
hath removed the rubbish that might hinder the raising up of that
godly structure appointed and prescribed by the Lord in His
Word.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were to stick to the truth, contended the
preacher, quoting the edict of the Emperor Justinian in the Arian
controversy, and the reply of Basil the Great to the
Emperor&rsquo;s deputy: &lsquo;That none trained up in Holy
Scriptures would suffer one syllable of Divine truth to be
betrayed; but were ready, if it be required, to suffer any death
in the defence thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; People, he maintained, are
ever carried on by the example of their governors.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How,&rsquo; he asks, &lsquo;was the Eastern Empire
polluted with execrable Arianism, whilst yet the Western
continued in the truth?&nbsp; The historians give the reason of
it.&nbsp; Constantine, an Arian, ruled in the East when at the
same time <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>Constans and Constantius, sons to
Constantine the Great, treading in the steps of their pious
father, adhered to the truth professed by him, and so did as far
ennoble the Western Empire with the truth as the other did defile
the Eastern with his countenancing of error and
heresy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The preacher here asks his hearers to make
no laws against religion and piety, and &lsquo;recall such as
have been made in time of ignorance against the same, and study
to uphold and maintain such profitable and wholesome laws as have
been formerly enacted for God and His people.&nbsp; Improve what
was well begun by others before you, and not perfected by
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Under this latter head he dwelt on the
possible abuse of the Holy Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
and the irreligious profanation of the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>In 1643 the Earl of Manchester ejected many of the Royalist
clergymen from their livings who were scandalous ministers.&nbsp;
Dr. Sterne having been deprived of the mastership of Jesus
College, Cambridge, the Stowmarket Vicar was placed there in his
stead.&nbsp; He held the situation till 1654, when, on his
refusal of the engagement, Government deprived him of his
office.&nbsp; At the time the sermon was preached Dr. Young was
one of the far-famed <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>Assembly of Divines which met in
Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel in accordance with the Solemn League
and Covenant, which proposed three grand objects: &lsquo;To
endeavour the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy superstition,
heresy, and profaneness; to endeavour the preservation of the
reformed religion in Scotland and the reformation of religion in
the kingdoms of England and Ireland in doctrine, worship,
discipline, and government according to the Word of God and the
example of the best Reformed Church; and to endeavour to bring
the Churches of God in the three kingdoms to the nearest
conjunction and uniformity in religion&mdash;confession of faith,
form of Church government, directory for worship and catechizing;
that we and our posterity after us may as brethren live in faith
and love, and that the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; A clause was inserted to the effect that it was
English prelacy which they contemned; and thus modified, after
all due solemnities, and with their right hands lifted to heaven,
was the Solemn League and Covenant sworn to by the English
Parliament and by the Assembly of Divines in St. Margaret&rsquo;s
Church, September 25, 1643.&nbsp; It was, writes a Presbyterian
divine, too much the creature of the Long Parliament who convoked
the meeting, <!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>selected the members of Assembly,
nominated its president, prescribed its bye-laws, and kept a firm
hold and a vigilant eye on all their proceedings.&nbsp; Still,
with all these drawbacks, it must be admitted that Parliament
could hardly have made a selection of more pious, learned, and
conscientious men.&nbsp; The Assembly consisted of men nominated
by the members for each county sending in suitable names.&nbsp;
The two divines appointed for Suffolk were Mr. Thomas Young, of
Stowmarket, and Mr. John Phillips, of Rentall.&nbsp; The Vicar,
it is said, sometimes acted as chairman, but this, as Mr.
Hollingsworth remarks, is doubtful.</p>
<p>Mr. Young&rsquo;s claim to fame rests on something greater
than his sermon, or his position in the Assembly of Divines at
Westminster, or his mastership of Jesus College.&nbsp; He was, as
we have said, Milton&rsquo;s schoolmaster.&nbsp; The poet tells
us:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis education forms the common
mind;<br />
Just as a twig is bent the tree&rsquo;s inclined.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If so, much of Milton&rsquo;s piety and lofty principle and
massive learning must have come to him from the Stowmarket
Vicar.&nbsp; In our day there is little chance of a young scholar
becoming imbued with Miltonian ideas on the subject of civil and
religious <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>liberty.&nbsp; That sublime genius
which was to sing in immortal verse of</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Man&rsquo;s first disobedience, and the
fruit<br />
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste<br />
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>must have owed much to Dr. Young&mdash;a debt which the poet
acknowledged, as we have already seen, in no niggardly way.&nbsp;
Amongst Milton&rsquo;s Latin letters is the following, which has
been translated by Professor Masson thus: &lsquo;Although I had
resolved with myself, most excellent preceptor, to send you a
certain small epistle composed in metrical numbers, yet I did not
consider that I had done enough unless I also wrote something in
prose: for, truly, the singular and boundless gratitude of my
mind which your deserts justly claim from me was not to be
expressed in that cramped mode of speech, straitened by fixed
feet and syllables, but in a free oration&mdash;nay, rather, if
it were possible, in an Asiatic exuberance of words.&nbsp; To
express sufficiently how much I owe you, were a work far greater
than my strength, even if I should call into play all those
commonplaces of argument which Aristotle or that dialectician of
Paris (Ramus) has collected, or even if I should exhaust all the
fountains of oratory.&nbsp; You complain <!-- page 303--><a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>as justly
that my letters have been to you very few and very short; but I,
on the other hand, do not so much grieve that I have been remiss
in a duty so pleasant and so enviable, as I rejoice, and all but
exult, at having such a place in your friendship, as that you
should care to ask for frequent letters from me.&nbsp; That I
should never have written to you for over more than three years,
I pray you will not misconceive, but, in accordance with your
wonderful indulgence and candour, put the more charitable
construction on it; for I call God to witness how much, as a
father, I regard you, with what singular devotion I have always
followed you in thought, and how I feared to trouble you with my
writings.&nbsp; In sooth, I make it my first care, that since
there is nothing else to commend my letters, that their rarity
may commend them.&nbsp; Next, as out of that most vehement desire
after you which I feel, I always fancy you with me, and speak to
you, and beheld you as if you were present, and so, as always
happens in love, soothe my grief by a certain vain imagination of
your presence, it is, in truth, my fear, as soon as I meditate
sending you a letter, that it should suddenly come into my mind
by what an interval of earth you are distant from me, and so the
grief of your absence, already <!-- page 304--><a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>nearly
lulled, should grow fresh and break up my sweet dream.&nbsp; The
Hebrew Bible, your truly most acceptable gift, I have already
received.&nbsp; These lines I have written in London, in the
midst of town distractions, not, as usual, surrounded by books;
if, therefore, anything in this epistle should please you less
than might be, and disappoint your expectations, it will be made
up for by another more elaborate one as soon as I have returned
to the haunts of the Muses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the above letter was written, Milton had become a
Cambridge student, where he was to experience a new kind of
tutor.&nbsp; Milton could not get on with Chappell as he did with
Young.&nbsp; The tie between the Stowmarket Vicar and the poet
was of a much more cordial character.</p>
<p>Again the poet appears to have forwarded the following letter
to the Stowmarket Vicarage.&nbsp; It is to be feared that few
such precious epistles find their way there now.&nbsp; Milton
writes to the Doctor: &lsquo;On looking at your letter, most
excellent preceptor, this alone struck me as superfluous, that
you excused your slowness in writing; for though nothing could
come to me more desirable than your letters, how could I or ought
I to hope that you should have so much leisure from serious and
<!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>more sacred affairs, especially as that is a matter
entirely of kindness, and not at all of duty?&nbsp; That,
however, I should suspect that you had forgotten me, your so many
recent kindnesses to me would by no means allow.&nbsp; I do not
see how you could dismiss out of your memory one laden with so
great benefits by you.&nbsp; Having been invited by you to your
part of the country, as soon as spring has a little advanced I
will gladly come to enjoy the delights of the year, and not less
of your conversation, and will then withdraw myself from the din
of town to your Stoa of the Iceni, as to that most celebrated
porch of Zeno or the Tusculan Villa of Cicero, where you with
moderate means, but regal spirit, like some Serranus or Curius,
placidly reign in your little farm, and contemning fortune, hold
as it were a triumph over riches, ambition, pomp, luxury, and
whatever the herd of man admire and are amazed by.&nbsp; But as
you have deprecated the blame of slowness, you will also, I hope,
pardon me the fault of haste; for having put off this letter, I
preferred writing little, and that rather in a slovenly manner,
to not writing at all.&nbsp; Farewell, much-to-be respected
Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The question is, Did Milton carry out this intention, and pay
Stowmarket a visit?&nbsp; Professor <!-- page 306--><a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>Masson
thinks he may have been there in the memorable summer and autumn
of 1630.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Hollingsworth, the Stowmarket
historian argues that it is not unlikely that several, if not
many, visits, extending over a period of thirty years, while the
tutor held the living, were made by the poet to the place.&nbsp;
Tradition has constantly associated his name with the
mulberry-trees of the Vicarage, which he planted, but of these
only one remains.&nbsp; &lsquo;This venerable relic of the
past,&rsquo; continues the Vicar, &lsquo;is much decayed, and is
still in vigorous bearing.&nbsp; Its girth, before it breaks into
branches, is ten feet, and I have had in one season as much as
ten gallons from the pure juices of its fruits, which yields a
highly flavoured and brilliant-coloured wine.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
stands a few yards distant from the oldest part of the house, and
opposite the windows of an upstair double room, which was
formerly the sitting-parlour of the Vicar, and where, it is to be
believed, the poet and his friend had many a talk of the way to
advance religion and liberty in the land, to remove hirelings out
of the Church, and to abolish the Bishops.&nbsp; There too,
perhaps, might have come to the guest visions of &lsquo;Paradise
Lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; In his first work Milton throws out something
like a hint of the great <!-- page 307--><a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>poem which
he was in time to write.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then, amidst,&rsquo; to
quote his own sonorous language, &lsquo;the hymns and hallelujahs
of saints, <i>someone</i> may, perhaps, be heard offering in high
strains, in new and lofty measures, to sing and celebrate Thy
Divine mercies and marvellous judgments in this land throughout
all ages.&rsquo;&nbsp; We can easily believe how, in the
Stowmarket Vicarage, the plan of the poet may have been talked
over, and the heart of the poet encouraged to the work.&nbsp;
Regarding Young as Milton did, we may be sure that he would have
been only too glad to listen to his suggestions and adopt his
advice.&nbsp; There must have been a good deal of plain living
and high thinking at the Stowmarket Vicarage when Milton came
there as an occasional guest.&nbsp; This is the more probable as
Milton&rsquo;s earliest publications were in support of the views
of Smectymnian divines.&nbsp; His friendship for Young probably
led him into the field of controversy, for he owns that he was
not disposed to this manner of writing &lsquo;wherein, knowing
myself inferior to myself, led by the genial power of nature to
another task, I have the use, as I may account, but of my left
hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a fact that Milton was thus drawn into
the controversy, and what more natural than that he should have
been <!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>induced to do so by the Stowmarket
Vicar in the Stowmarket Vicarage?&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s family
were familiar with that part of Suffolk, and his brother, Sir
Christopher, who was a stanch Royalist and barrister, lived at
Ipswich, but twelve miles off.&nbsp; He went to see Milton, and
Milton might have visited Ipswich and Stowmarket at the same
time.&nbsp; Be that as it may, tradition and probability alike
justify the belief that Milton came to Stowmarket, and that he
went away all the wiser and better, all the stronger to do good
work for man and God, for his age and all succeeding ages.&nbsp;
Young, as it may be inferred, was held in high honour by his
friends.&nbsp; He was spoken of by two neighbouring ejected
Rectors as the reverend, learned, orthodox, prudent, and holy Dr.
Young.&nbsp; When he died, an epitaph was inscribed with some
care by a friendly hand, and an unwilling admission is made of
the opposition he had encountered.&nbsp; It is now illegible, and
some of its lines appear to have been carefully erased&mdash;by
some High Church chisel, probably.&nbsp; But the following copy
was made when the epitaph was fresh and legible:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Here is committed to earth&rsquo;s trust<br
/>
Wise, pious, spotlesse, learned dust,<br />
Who living more adorned the place<br />
Than the place him.&nbsp; Such was God&rsquo;s grace.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>Is the verse of this epitaph from Milton&rsquo;s pen or
not?&nbsp; Mr. Hollingsworth writes: &lsquo;The probability is
quite in favour that the pupil should write the last memorial of
one whom he so highly honoured and loved as his old master.&nbsp;
Nor is the verse itself, with the exception of the last line,
unlike the character of Milton&rsquo;s poetry, and this last may
have been mutilated and rendered inharmonious by the action of
the stone-cutter, who also confused the death of the father and
son.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is pleasant to think, not only that Milton
now and then came to the Stowmarket Vicarage, but that in the
church itself there is a slight record of his poetical
fame.&nbsp; Let me add, as a further illustration of the
connection of the great poet with the county of Suffolk, that I
am informed one of the family of the Meadowses, of Witnesham, was
for a time one of his secretaries.</p>
<p>Young died, aged sixty-eight, in the year 1655, when Milton
was fully embarked in public life, when he could spare but little
time; but we may be sure that he would be the last at that time
of life to forget all that he owed to his tutor Young.&nbsp; Wife
and son had predeceased the Vicar.&nbsp; It seems as if there was
no one left but the poet to record on the marble in the middle
aisle, in front <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>of the present reading-desk, the
virtues of a character which had long exercised so beneficial an
influence on his own, and which he had loved so well.&nbsp;
Milton&rsquo;s regret for the loss of such a guide, philosopher,
and friend must have been lasting and sincere.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">East Bergholt&mdash;The Valley of the
Stour&mdash;Painting from nature&mdash;East Anglian girls.</p>
<p>Charles Kingsley was wont to glorify the teaching of the
hills, and to maintain that the man of the mountain is more
imaginative and poetical than the man of the plain.&nbsp; There
are many Scotch people, mostly those born in the Highlands, who
tell us much the same.&nbsp; If the theory be true&mdash;and I am
not aware that it is&mdash;the exceptions are striking and
many.&nbsp; Lincolnshire is rather a flat country, but it gave us
(I can never bring myself to call him Lord) Alfred
Tennyson.&nbsp; Many of our greatest poets and artists were
cockneys; and Constable, that sweet painter of cornfields and
shady lanes and quiet rivers, used to say that the scenes of his
boyhood made him a painter.&nbsp; I was one autumn in
Constable&rsquo;s county, and I do not wonder at it.&nbsp; It is
a wonderful district.&nbsp; I <!-- page 312--><a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>trod all
the while, it seemed to me, on enchanted ground: in the gilded
mist of autumn, with its river and its marsh lands, where the
cows lazily fed&mdash;or got under the pollards to be out of the
way of the flies&mdash;where laughing children swarmed along the
hedges in pursuit of the ripe blackberry, where every cottage
front was a thing of beauty, with its ivy creeping up the roof or
over the wall; while the little garden was a mass of
flowers.&nbsp; We expected to see the old gods and goddesses
again to participate in the joyousness of an ancient mirth.</p>
<p>Nor was it altogether a flat land, sacred to fat cattle and
wheat and turnips.&nbsp; All round me were the elements of
romance.&nbsp; At one end of the Vale of Dedham is a hill whence
you may look all along the valley (Constable has made it the
subject of one of his pictures) as far as Harwich; and as I
lingered by the Stour&mdash;the river which divides Essex and
Suffolk&mdash;East Bergholt, clothed with woods and crowned with
a church, in which there is a stained-glass window put up in
honour of Constable, and a baptismal font, the gift of
Constable&rsquo;s brother, unfolded to my wondering eye all her
rural charms.&nbsp; There are people who love to climb hills; I
hate to do so.&nbsp; It is all vanity and <!-- page 313--><a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>vexation of
spirit; when you get to the top of one hill the chances are all
you see is another hill, to the top of which you will have to
climb.&nbsp; Give me a country lane, with its luxuriant hedges,
its shady trees, its flowers, its richness of greensward, its
pigs and poultry and farmyard; there is poetry in such nooks and
corners of the earth, as Burns and Bloomfield and Gerald Massey
found.&nbsp; No wonder the place made Constable an artist, and an
artist whose name will not speedily pass away.&nbsp; My dear sir
or madam, the next time you are on your way from London to
Ipswich, don&rsquo;t rush along at express speed; get out at
Ardleigh, make your way to the Vale of Dedham, then walk along
the Stour, and cross it by a couple of rustic bridges, and you
are at East Bergholt, in Suffolk, where Constable was born, and
if you do so you will bless me evermore.&nbsp; Then, if you like,
rejoin the train at Manningtree, and resume your journey.&nbsp;
Few East Anglians even are aware of the wealth of beauty in that
quiet corner.&nbsp; &lsquo;The beauty of the surrounding
scenery,&rsquo; writes Constable&rsquo;s biographer, &lsquo;its
gentle declivities, its luxuriant meadows, flats sprinkled with
flocks and herds, its well-cultivated Uplands, its woods and
rivers, with mansions scattered, and churches, farms, and
picturesque <!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>cottages&mdash;all impart to this
spot an amenity and elegance hardly anywhere else to be
found.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Constables have been long in the district.&nbsp; The
grandfather was a farmer at a village close by.&nbsp; The father,
who was well-to-do, purchased a water-mill at Dedham and two
windmills at East Bergholt, where he lived.&nbsp; The great
artist, his son John, was born in the last century, and was
educated at Lavenham and the Dedham Grammar School, and when the
lad had reached sixteen or seventeen became addicted to painting,
his studio being in the house of a Mr. John Dunthorne, a painter
and glazier, with whom he remained on terms of the greatest
intimacy for many years.&nbsp; The father would fain have made
the son a farmer.&nbsp; He preferred to be a miller, and in his
young days was known in the district as the handsome
miller.&nbsp; His windmills, when he took to painting, were
wonderful, and well deserved the criticism of his brother, who
used to say, &lsquo;When I look at a windmill painted by John, I
see that it will go round, which is not always the case with
those of other artists,&rsquo; for the simple reason that John
knew what he was about, which the others did not.&nbsp; Again,
his industrial career helped him in another way.&nbsp; A miller
learns to study the clouds, and Constable&rsquo;s <!-- page
315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>clouds were exceptionally life-like and real.&nbsp; The
handsome young miller soon acquired artistic friends, one of them
being Sir George Beaumont, the guide, philosopher, and friend of
most of the geniuses of that time.&nbsp; Said another to him,
&lsquo;Do not trouble yourself about inventing figures for a
landscape; you cannot remain an hour in a spot without the
appearance of some living thing, that will in all probability
better accord with the scene and the time of day than any
invention of your own.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a visit to his artist
friends in London, he resumed his mill life, and in 1779 he
finally commenced his artistic career, and painted all the
country round.&nbsp; His studies were chiefly Dedham, East
Bergholt, the Valley of the Stour, and the neighbouring village
of Stratford.&nbsp; At Stoke Nayland he painted an altar-piece
for the church.&nbsp; There is also another altar-piece in a
neighbouring church, but his altar-pieces are not known or
treasured like his other works.</p>
<p>Cooper tells a good story of Constable.&nbsp; One day Stodart,
the sculptor, met Fuseli starting forth with an old
umbrella.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you carry the umbrella?&rsquo;
asked the sculptor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am going to see
Constable,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;and he is always painting
rain.&rsquo;&nbsp; One can only remark that, if <!-- page
316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>Constable was always painting rain, he always did it
well.</p>
<p>Another good story was told Redgrave by Lee.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
hear you sell all your pictures,&rsquo; said Constable to the
younger landscape-painter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; said
Lee; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m pretty fortunate.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
sell yours?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Constable,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t sell any of my pictures, and I&rsquo;ll tell
you why: when I paint a <i>bad</i> picture I don&rsquo;t like to
part with it, and when I paint a <i>good</i> one I like to keep
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is well known that one year when Constable
was on the Council of the Royal Academy, one of his own pictures
was passed by mistake before the judges.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cross
it,&rsquo; said one.&nbsp; &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said
another.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pass on,&rsquo; said a third.&nbsp; And the
carpenter was just about to chalk it with a cross, when he read
the name of &lsquo;John Constable.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course there
were lame apologies, and the picture was taken from the condemned
heap and placed with the works of his brother Academicians.&nbsp;
But after work was over Constable took the picture under his arm,
and, despite the remonstrance of his brother colleagues, marched
off with it, saving: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think of its being hung
after it has been fairly turned out.&nbsp; The work so condemned
was the &lsquo;Stream bordered in with Willows,&rsquo; now in the
South Kensington <!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>Museum.&nbsp; Leslie once remarked
to Redgrave that he would give any work he had painted for it, so
warmly did he admire it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Constable is the best landscape-painter we have,&rsquo;
wrote Frith to his mother in 1835.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a very
merry fellow, and very rich.&nbsp; He told us an anecdote of a
man who came to look at his pictures; he was a gardener.&nbsp;
One day he called him into his painting-room to look at his
pictures, when the man made the usual vulgar remarks, such as,
&ldquo;Did you do all this, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What, all this?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What, frame and all?&rdquo;&nbsp;
At last he came to an empty frame that was hung against the wall
without any picture in it, when he said to Constable, &ldquo;But
you don&rsquo;t call this picture quite finished, do you,
sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; Constable said that quite sickened him, and he
never let any ignoramuses ever see his pictures again, or frames
either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constable&rsquo;s great merits, writes Mr. Frith, were first
recognised in France, with the result upon French landscape art
that is felt at the present time.&nbsp; His advice to Frith was:
&lsquo;Never do anything without nature before you if it be
possible to have it.&nbsp; See those weeds and the dock
leaves?&nbsp; They are to come into the foreground of this <!--
page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>picture.&nbsp; I know dock leaves pretty well, but I
should not attempt to introduce them into a picture without
having them before me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constable died very suddenly in 1837.&nbsp; His fame, now that
he is dead, is greater than when he was alive.&nbsp; His work
abides in all its strength.</p>
<p>There is little in East Bergholt to remind one of Constable,
where his reputation remains as that of a genial and
kindly-hearted man; but the landscape in all its essential
features remains the same.&nbsp; The house in which he was born
was pulled down in 1841, which is a great pity, as it is
described as a large and handsome mansion.&nbsp; But I never saw
a small village with so many attractive residences, though why
anybody should live in any of them I could not, for the life of
me, understand.&nbsp; Yet there they were, quite a street of
them, all in beautiful order, as if they were the residences of
wealthy citizens in the suburbs of a busy town.&nbsp; They ought
to have been filled with handsome girls, as Charles Kingsley
tells us East Anglia is famed for the beauty of its women; all I
can say, however, is that I saw none of them, or any sign of life
anywhere, beyond the inevitable tradesmen&rsquo;s carts.&nbsp;
Independently of Constable, East Bergholt claims to be worth a
pilgrimage for its rustic beauty, <!-- page 319--><a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>which,
however, becomes tame and common as you get away from it.&nbsp;
The church is old, and has a history&mdash;of little consequence,
however, to anyone now.&nbsp; One of its rectors was burned at
Ipswich in Queen Mary&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; His name, Samuel,
ought to be preserved by a Church which, till lately, had few
martyrs of its own.&nbsp; East Bergholt has also a Congregational
and Primitive Methodist chapel, and a colony of Benedictine nuns,
driven away from France by the great Revolution.&nbsp; We are a
hospitable people, and we are proud to be so, but have we not
just at this time too many refugee nuns and monks in our
midst?</p>

<p>Abbo Floriacencis, who flourished in the year <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 910, describes East Anglia as
&lsquo;very noble, and particularly because of its being watered
on all sides.&nbsp; On the south and east it is encompassed by
the ocean, on the north by the moisture of large and wet fens
which, arising almost in the heart of the island, because of the
evenness of the ground for a hundred miles and more, descend in
great rivers into the sea.&nbsp; On the west the province is
joyned to the rest of the island, and, therefore, may be entered
(by land); but lest it should be harassed by the frequent
incursions of the enemy it is fortifyed with an earthen rampire
like a high wall, and with a ditch.&nbsp; The inner parts of it
is a pretty rich soil, made exceeding pleasant by gardens and
groves, rendered agreeable by its <!-- page 321--><a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>convenience
for hunting, famous for pasturage, and abounding with sheep and
all sorts of cattle.&nbsp; I do not insist upon its rivers full
of fish, considering that a tongue as it were of the sea itself
licks it on one side, and on the other side the large fens make a
prodigious number of lakes two or three miles over.&nbsp; These
fens accommodate great numbers of monks with their desired
retirement and solitude, with which, being enclosed, they have no
occasion for the privacy of a wilderness.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before the
monks came the place was held by the Iceni&mdash;a stout and
valiant people, as Tacitus describes them.&nbsp; In the time of
the Heptarchy, King Uffa was their lord and master.&nbsp; In
later times Suffolk, when explored by Camden, was celebrated for
its cheeses, which, to the great advantage of the inhabitants,
were bought up through all England, nay, in Germany also, with
France and Spain, as Pantaleon Medicus has told us, who scruples
not to set them against those of Placentia both in colour and
taste.&nbsp; To the Norfolk people, it must be admitted, Camden
gives the palm.&nbsp; The goodness of the soil of that country,
he argues, &lsquo;may be gathered from hence, that the
inhabitants are of a bright, clear complexion, not to mention
their sharpness of wit and admirable quickness in the <!-- page
322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>study of our common law.&nbsp; So that it is at
present, and always has been, reputed the common nursery of
lawyers, and even amongst the common people you shall meet with a
great many who (as one expresses it), if they have no just
quarrel, are able to raise it out of the very quirks and niceties
of the law.&rsquo;&nbsp; In our time it is rather the fashion to
run down the East Anglians, yet that they have done their duty to
their country no one can deny.&nbsp; &lsquo;They say we are
Norfolk fules,&rsquo; said a waiter at a Norfolk hotel, to me, a
little while ago; &lsquo;but I ain&rsquo;t ashamed of my county,
for all that.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why should he be, the reader naturally
asks?</p>
<p>The Saxons of East Anglia gave the name of England to this
land of ours; but before this time East Anglia had attained, by
means of its sons and daughters, to fame far and near.&nbsp; If
we may believe Gildas, a Christian church was planted in England
in the time of Nero.&nbsp; Claudia, to whom Paul refers in
Philippians and Timothy, was a British lady of great wit and
greater beauty, celebrated by the poet Martial.&nbsp; She may
have been converted by Paul, argued the Rev. Mr. Hollingsworth, a
local historian, Rural Dean and Rector of Stowmarket; nor is it
at all improbable, he adds, &lsquo;that Claudia, the British
beauty, may have been <!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 323</span>an Iceni, or East Anglian lady, as
her brilliant complexion, for which so many in these counties are
celebrated, had caused a vivid feeling of sensation and curiosity
and envy even among the haughty dames of the imperial city of
Rome.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Romans were glad to make terms with the
Iceni till the unfortunate Boadicea perished in the revolt which
she had so rashly raised.&nbsp; The Saxons came after the Romans,
and took possession of the land.&nbsp; Saxon proprietors
compelled the people, whose lives they spared, to till the very
lands on which their fathers had lived under the Roman Government
or their own chiefs.&nbsp; Pagan worship was reintroduced; but
when Sigberht, the son of Redwald, King of East Anglia, reigned,
he sent to France for Christian ministers, and one of them,
Felix, a Burgundian, landed at Felixstowe, and there commenced
his Christian labours.&nbsp; Felix was held in high repute by the
Bishops in other parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; His opinions were
quoted and revered.&nbsp; The diocese was large, and the fourth
Bishop divided it into two parts, the second Bishop being planted
at North Elmham, in Norfolk.&nbsp; In 955 the see was again
united, when Erfastus, the twenty-second Bishop, removed to
Thetford.&nbsp; A little while after the Bishop&rsquo;s residence
was removed <!-- page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 324</span>to Norwich, and there it has ever
since remained; but the land was not long permitted to remain in
peace.&nbsp; In 870 a large party of Danes marched from
Lincolnshire into Suffolk, defeated King Edmund, near Hoxne, and,
as he would not become an idolater, shot him to death with
arrows.&nbsp; Bury St. Edmunds still preserves the name and fame
of one of the most illustrious of our Anglo-Saxon martyrs.&nbsp;
King Alfred, with a policy worthy of his sagacity, made Guthrum,
the Danish governor of Suffolk, a Christian, and continued him in
his rule.&nbsp; The Danes in East Anglia were then an immense
army, and thus at once they were turned from foes into
friends.&nbsp; Guthrum was baptized, and it is to be hoped was
all the better for it.&nbsp; At any rate, he returned to Suffolk
and divided many of the estates which had been held by Saxon
proprietors killed in war.&nbsp; He died in peace, and had a
fitting funeral at Hadleigh.&nbsp; The children of those Danish
soldiers were dangerous friends, and too frequently betrayed the
Saxons.&nbsp; Blood is thicker than water, and as each succeeding
band of Danish adventurers landed on our eastern coast, they were
welcomed by such followers of Guthrum as had settled in Suffolk
as friends and allies.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Danes found the
conquest <!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>of the island impossible.&nbsp;
Divine Providence, Mr. Hollingsworth tells us, did not suffer the
Saxon race to be vanquished by those who were connected with them
by blood.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the struggle was long and
severe.&nbsp; The two races were equally matched in courage, but
the Saxon surpassed his foe in that stern, unyielding endurance
which enabled him to resist every defeat and prepare again for
the contest.&nbsp; The whole surface of the country became
studded with entrenchments, moats, and mounds, within whose line
the harassed Saxon defended his property and all he valued in his
home.&nbsp; History begins, as far as England is practically
concerned, with the Norman Conquest.&nbsp; It was then the
Norsemen, blue-eyed, fair-haired, the finest blood in Europe,
planted themselves in Norfolk and Suffolk, and brought with them
feudalism and civilization.&nbsp; It was in 787 that, according
to the Saxon Chronicle, they first reached England; but it was
not till William the Conqueror made the land his own that they
settled as English lords, and divided between them the land in
which their rapacious forefathers had won many a precious
treasure.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The red gold and the white silver<br />
He covets as a leech does blood,&rsquo;</p>

<p>wrote an old poet of the Norseman.</p>
<p><!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>Let us take, as an illustration of the county, a
Norfolk family.&nbsp; In Westminster Abbey there is monument to
Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, who was buried in the ruined chancel of
the little church at Overstrand, near Northrepps, &lsquo;a droll,
irregular, unconventional-looking place,&rsquo; as Caroline Fox
calls it, where he loved at all times to live, and where he
retired to die.&nbsp; The family from which Sir Thomas descended
resided, about the middle of the sixteenth century, at Sudbury,
in Suffolk.&nbsp; It was while at Earlham that he made his
d&eacute;but as a public speaker at one of the earlier meetings
of the Norfolk Bible Society.&nbsp; In the winter of 1817 he went
over to France with some of the Gurneys and the Rev. Francis
Cunningham, who was anxious to establish a Bible Society in
Paris.&nbsp; He was also anxious to inquire into the way in which
the gaols at Antwerp and Ghent were conducted.&nbsp; On his
return he examined minutely into the state of the London gaols,
and, to use his own expression, his inquiries developed a system
of folly and wickedness which surpassed belief.&nbsp; In the
following year he published a work entitled &lsquo;An Inquiry
whether Crime be Produced or Prevented by our Present System of
Penal Discipline,&rsquo; which ran through six editions, and
tended powerfully to create a proper <!-- page 327--><a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>public
feeling on the subject.&nbsp; In 1819 we find him in Parliament
seconding Sir James Mackintosh in his efforts to promote a reform
of our criminal law&mdash;then the most sanguinary in
Europe.&nbsp; One of his earliest efforts was to get the House to
abolish the burning of widows in India; and in 1821 he received
from Wilberforce the command to relieve him of a responsibility
too heavy for his advancing years and infirmities&mdash;the care
of the slave: a holy enterprise for which Mr. Buxton had been
qualifying himself by careful thought and study, and which he was
spared to carry to a successful end.&nbsp; At first he resided at
Cromer Hall, an old seat of the Windham family, which no longer
exists, having been pulled down and replaced by a modern
residence.&nbsp; It was situated about a quarter of a mile from
the sea, but sheltered from the north winds by closely
surrounding hills and woods, and with its old buttresses, gables,
and porches clothed with roses and jessamine, and its famed lawn,
where the pheasants came down to feed, had a peculiar character
of picturesque simplicity.&nbsp; The interior corresponded with
its external appearance, and had little of the regularity of
modern building.&nbsp; One attic chamber was walled up, with no
entrance save through the window: and at different times <!--
page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>large pits were discovered under the floor or in the
thick walls&mdash;used, it was supposed, in old times by the
smugglers of the coast.&nbsp; There is much picturesque scenery
around Cromer, and large parties were often made up for
excursions to Sherringham&mdash;one of the most beautiful spots
in all the eastern counties, to the wooded dells of Felbrigg and
Runton, or to the rough heath ground by the beach beacon.&nbsp;
One who was a frequent guest at Cromer Hall wrote: &lsquo;I wish
I could describe the impression made upon me by the extraordinary
power of interesting and stimulating others which was possessed
by Sir Fowell Buxton some thirty years ago.&nbsp; In my own case
it was like having powers of thinking, powers of feeling, and,
above all, the love of true poetry suddenly aroused within me,
which, though I had possessed them before, had been till then
unused.&nbsp; From Locke &ldquo;On the Human
Understanding,&rdquo; to &ldquo;William of Deloraine, good at
need,&rdquo; <i>he</i> woke up in me the sleeping principle of
taste, and, in giving me such objects of pursuit, has added
immeasurably to the happiness of my life.&rsquo;&nbsp; On a
Sunday afternoon, we are told, his large dining-hall was filled
with a miscellaneous audience of fishermen and neighbours, as
well as of his own household, to whom he would read the <!-- page
329--><a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>Bible, commenting on it at the same time.&nbsp; Very
simple and beautiful seems to us that far-away Norfolk life;
except that his hospitalities were more bounded by want of room,
his life at Northrepps was much the same as it had been at Cromer
Hall.&nbsp; It is one of the pleasures of my life that I have
heard Sir Thomas speak.&nbsp; In modern England the influence of
the Buxton family and name is yet a power.</p>
<p>Having already alluded to the Windhams and Felbrigg, it
remains to say that the last of that illustrious line died in
1810.&nbsp; Felbrigg was purchased by the Windhams as far back as
1461.&nbsp; The public life of Windham, the statesman, may be
considered as having commenced in 1783, when he undertook the
office of Principal Secretary to Lord Northington, who was
appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.&nbsp; The great Marquis of
Lansdowne, when he was last at Felbrigg, in 1861, said Mr.
Windham had the best Parliamentary address of any man he had ever
seen, which was enhanced by the grace of his person and the
dignity of his manners.&nbsp; Still more glowing was the
testimony borne to Mr. Windham by Earl Grey when he heard of his
death.&nbsp; A mere glance at his diary is sufficient to convince
us that Windham, <!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 330</span>when in London, mixed with the first
men and women of his time.&nbsp; The late Lord Chief Justice
Scarlett, on being asked by his son-in-law to name the very best
speech he had heard during his life, and that which he thought
most worthy of study, answered, without hesitation,
&lsquo;Windham&rsquo;s speech on the Law of
Evidence.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a conversation with Lord Palmerston,
Pitt observed of Windham: &lsquo;Nothing can be so well-meaning
or eloquent as he is.&nbsp; His speeches are the finest
productions possible of warm imagination and fancy.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In 1800 we read in the Malmesbury Diaries that old George III.
had meant Windham to be his First Minister.&nbsp; As a friend of
Burke and Johnson, Windham&rsquo;s name will not easily fade
away.&nbsp; It is to him we owe the most pathetic account of the
closing hours of the Monarch of Bolt Court.</p>
<p>Sir Cloudesley Shovel may well claim to be one of
Norfolk&rsquo;s heroes.&nbsp; Born in an obscure village, an
apprentice to a shoemaker, he obtained rank and fame as one of
Queen Anne&rsquo;s most honoured Admirals.&nbsp; It is denied
that he was in very humble circumstances, and it is a fact that
his original letters were so well worded as to indicate that he
had received a fair education.&nbsp; At any rate, he went to sea
at ten years old with <!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>his friend Sir John Hadough; and
although not a cabin-boy in the modern acceptation of that term,
he undertook his captain&rsquo;s errands, swimming on one
occasion through the enemy&rsquo;s fire with some despatches for
a distant ship, carrying the papers in his mouth, displaying a
courage worthy of admiration.&nbsp; He distinguished himself in
the Battle of Bantry Bay.&nbsp; As an enemy of France and Spain,
he triumphed in many a fierce fight.&nbsp; Returning home flushed
with victory, his ship and all on board were lost on the Scilly
Isles in an October gale.&nbsp; Some uncertainty hangs over his
last moments.&nbsp; It is asserted that he swam to shore alive,
and that he was put to death for the sake of his ring of emeralds
and diamonds.&nbsp; An ancient woman is stated to have confessed
as much.&nbsp; For the honour of human nature, we would fain
believe the story to be untrue.&nbsp; A still greater Norfolk
hero was Lord Nelson, who is buried in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral.&nbsp; &lsquo;My principle,&rsquo; said Nelson, on one
occasion, &lsquo;is to assist in driving the French to the devil,
and in restoring peace and happiness to mankind.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Whether he succeeded as regards the former we are not in a
position to state; but peace and happiness, alas! are still far
from being the <!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>common property of mankind.&nbsp;
The rectory house at Burnham Thorpe, where Nelson was born,
exists no longer.&nbsp; Sir Cloudesley Shovel lived in a
castellated stone house in the small agricultural village of
Cockthorpe, originally fortified as a defence against the
incursions of smugglers.&nbsp; A room in this house, entered by a
doorway arched over with stone, is shown, which is still called
by the villagers Sir Cloudesley&rsquo;s drawing-room.</p>
<p>A chapter might be written about the Norfolk Cokes.&nbsp; Sir
Edward Coke, the great lawyer, was buried at Tittleshale, in
Norfolk.&nbsp; The well-known Coke, the distinguished
agriculturist, inhabited that splendid Holkham, the fame of which
exists in our day.&nbsp; It was begun by Lord Leicester in 1734,
and finished by his Countess in 1764.&nbsp; Blomefield, the
well-known Norfolk historian, speaks of it as a noble, stately,
and sumptuous palace.&nbsp; Lord Coke and Lord Burlington were
men of similar tastes and pursuits, and were diligent students of
classical and Italian art.&nbsp; The Holkham Library still
contains treasures rich and rare.&nbsp; Many of the latter formed
part of the library of Sir Edward Coke; the title-page of the
first edition of the &lsquo;Novum Organum,&rsquo; published in
1620, bears the design of a ship passing through <!-- page
333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>the Pillars of Hercules into an undulating sea.&nbsp;
The Holkham copy is adorned by the inscription, &lsquo;Ex dono
auctoris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Above the ship, in the handwriting of Coke, is the
couplet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It deserveth not to be read in schools,<br
/>
But to be freighted in the ship of fools.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Shadwell, the Poet Laureate and historiographer of
William III., was a Norfolk man.&nbsp; He is buried in
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; It is said by Noble that he was an
honest man.&nbsp; Of course he was.&nbsp; Chalmers accuses him of
indecent conversation, or Lord Rochester would not have said that
he had more wit and humour than any other poet.&nbsp; I am afraid
he confers little honour on his native county.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Others,&rsquo; wrote Dryden in one of his satires,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To some faint meaning make pretence,<br />
But Shadwell never deviates into sense.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Robert Walpole, who saved England from wooden shoes and
slavery, was of a Norfolk family, yet flourishing; as are the
Townshends, to whom we owe the introduction of the turnip.&nbsp;
Norfolk also can boast of Sir Thomas Gresham and Sir Francis
Walsingham.&nbsp; In Norfolk was born that &lsquo;great oracle of
law, patron of the Church, and <!-- page 334--><a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>glory of
England,&rsquo; as Camden calls him, Sir Henry Spelman.&nbsp; At
Bickling, in the same county, was born that ill-starred Anne
Boleyn, of whom it is written that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Love could teach a monarch to be wise,<br
/>
And Gospel light first beamed from Boleyn&rsquo;s
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same neighbourhood, also, was born John Baconthorpe,
the resolute doctor, of whom Pantias Pansa has written:
&lsquo;This one resolute doctor has furnished the Christian
religion with armour against the Jews stronger than that of
Vulcan.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pansa was a Norfolk man, and so was the
great botanist Sir W. Hooker.</p>
<p>Who has not heard of Lynn, in Norfolk, where, when Eugene Aram
was the usher,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Four-and-twenty happy boys<br />
Came bounding out of school&rsquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was in that old town Fanny Burney, the friend of Mrs.
Thrale and Dr. Johnson, the author of novels like
&lsquo;Evelina,&rsquo; which people even read nowadays, was born
on the 13th of June, 1752.&nbsp; She grew up low of stature, of a
brown complexion.&nbsp; One of her friends called her the dove,
which she thought was from the colour of her eyes&mdash;a
greenish-gray; her last editor thinks it must have <!-- page
335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>been from their kind expression.&nbsp; She was very
short-sighted, like her father.&nbsp; In her portrait, taken at
the age of thirty, merriment seems latent behind a demure
look.&nbsp; At any rate, her countenance was what might be called
a speaking one.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Fanny!&rsquo; said her father,
&lsquo;her face tells what she thinks, whether she will or
no.&nbsp; I long to see her honest face once more.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor Fanny&rsquo; lived to a good old age, and her
gossiping diary is a mine of wealth as regards the Royal Family,
and Johnson, and Mrs. Thrale, and the cleverest men and women of
her time.</p>
<p>Thomas Bilney, one of our Protestant martyrs, was a Norfolk
man.&nbsp; It was a Norfolk knight, Sir Thomas Erpingham, who
gave signal for the archers at Agincourt.&nbsp; Shakespeare
refers to him in his &lsquo;King Henry V.&rsquo; as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">King</span>.&mdash;Good-morrow, old Sir Thomas
Erpingham;<br />
A good soft pillow for that good white head<br />
Were better than a churlish turf of France.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Erp</span>.&mdash;Not so, my liege;
this lodging likes me better,<br />
Since I may say, now lie I like a king.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many East Anglians helped to win the battle of
Agincourt.&nbsp; The Earl of Kimberley still bears Agincourt on
his shield.</p>
<p>Let us now pass over into Suffolk.&nbsp; It is worth <!-- page
336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>asking how Suffolk came to earn the nickname of Silly
Suffolk.&nbsp; &lsquo;Silly,&rsquo; say the learned, is derived
from the German <i>selig</i>, meaning &lsquo;holy or
blessed,&rsquo; and is said to have been applied to Suffolk on
account of the number of beautiful churches it contains; Suffolk,
at any rate, is silly no longer.&nbsp; In the present day it
shows to advantage, if we may judge by the enterprise and public
spirit of such a town as Ipswich, for instance.&nbsp; Not long
since, as I landed on the docks at Hamburg, I had the pleasure of
seeing some dozen or more steam ploughs and agricultural
implements waiting to be transported into the interior.&nbsp; The
ploughs and implements bore well-known Suffolk names, such as
Garrett and Sons or Ransomes, Sims and Jefferies, and were open
manifestations of Suffolk skill and energy, and ability to hold
its own against all comers.&nbsp; Amongst the women of the
present generation, where are to be met the superiors of Mrs.
Garrett Anderson or of Mrs. Fawcett, widow of the distinguished
statesman, and mother of a sweet girl-graduate who has beaten all
the men at her University?&nbsp; I was the other day at
Haverhill, where Mr. D. Gurteen still lives to enjoy, at the ripe
old age of eighty-three, the fruits of an energy on his part
which has raised <!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 337</span>Haverhill from a village of paupers
into a flourishing community, whose manufactures are to be met
with all over the land.&nbsp; One day, as I was walking along
Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road, a fine, well-built man stopped me to ask
me if I remembered him.&nbsp; When he mentioned his name I did
directly.&nbsp; He was of the poorest of the poor in his home at
Wrentham.&nbsp; He had done well in London.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
know, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;how poor our family was.&nbsp;
Well, I had enough of poverty, and I made up my mind to come to
London and be either a man or a mouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the London of to-day the heads of some of our greatest
establishments are Suffolk men.&nbsp; We all know the stately
pile in Holborn, once Meekings&rsquo;, now Wallis&rsquo;s, where
all the world and his wife go to buy.&nbsp; Mr. Wallis hails from
Stowmarket, and the man who fits up London shops in the most
tasty style, Mr. Sage, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road, was a Suffolk
carpenter, who, when out of work, with his last guinea got some
cards printed, one of which got him a job, which ultimately led
on to fame and fortune.</p>
<p>No, Suffolk has long ceased to be silly.&nbsp; It must have
deserved the title in the days which I can remember when a
Conservative M.P., amidst <!-- page 338--><a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>enthusiastic cheering, at Ipswich, intimated that it
was quite as well the sun and moon were placed high up in the
heavens, else</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Some reforming ass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would soon propose to pluck them down<br />
And light the world with gas.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the oddest, most attractive, and most original women of
the last century was Elizabeth Simpson, a Suffolk girl, who ran
away from her home, where she was never taught anything, at the
age of sixteen, to make her fortune, and to win fame.&nbsp; In
both cases she succeeded, though not so soon as she could have
wished.&nbsp; Failing to touch the hard heart of the manager of
the Norwich Theatre, a Welshman of the name of Griffiths, she
packed up her things in a bandbox, and, good-looking and
audacious, landed herself on the Holborn pavement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By the time you receive this,&rsquo; she wrote to her
mother, &lsquo;I shall leave Standingfield perhaps for
ever.&nbsp; You are surprised, but be not uneasy; believe the
step I have undertaken is indiscreet, but by no means criminal,
unless I sin by not acquainting you with it.&nbsp; I now endure
every pang, am not lost to every feeling, on thus quitting the
tenderest and best of parents, I would say most beloved, too, but
cannot prove my affection, <!-- page 339--><a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>yet time
may.&nbsp; To that I must submit my hope of retaining your
regard.&nbsp; The censures of the world I despise, as the most
worthy incur the reproaches of that.&nbsp; Should I ever think
you will wish to hear from me I will write.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
pretty, unprotected, unknown girl of sixteen, in London, had, we
can well believe, no easy time of it.&nbsp; Strangers followed
her in the street, people insulted her in the theatre, suspicious
landladies looked her up.&nbsp; Happily, a brother-in-law met her
in a penniless state and took her home.&nbsp; Unhappily, at his
house she met Inchbald, an indifferent and badly-paid
actor.&nbsp; They were immediately married, and the girl rejoiced
to think that she was an actress, and about to realize the
ambition of her youth.&nbsp; It was no small part which the
Suffolk girl felt herself qualified to fill.&nbsp; On the 4th of
September, 1772, she made her d&eacute;but as Cordelia to her
husband&rsquo;s Lear.&nbsp; In 1821 Mrs. Inchbald, famed for her
&lsquo;simple story,&rsquo; which took the town by storm, was
buried in Kensington Churchyard.&nbsp; But before she got there
she had to endure much.&nbsp; At that time theatrical performers
were much worse paid than they are now, when, as Mr. Irving tells
us, any decent-looking young man, with a good suit of clothes,
can command his five <!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>or six pounds a week.&nbsp; Mrs.
Inchbald and her husband had to drink of the cup of poverty, and
its consequent degradation, to the dregs.&nbsp; On one occasion
they took it into their heads to go to France, believing that
they could make money&mdash;he by painting, she by writing.&nbsp;
The scheme, as was to be expected, did not answer, and they were
landed on their return somewhere near Brighton, in the September
of 1776, literally without a crust of bread.&nbsp; On one
occasion it was stated that they dined off raw turnips, stolen
from a field as they wandered past.&nbsp; Next year, however, the
world began to mend so far as they were concerned.</p>
<p>At Manchester they met the Siddonses and J. P. Kemble, and one
result of that meeting was peace and prosperity.&nbsp; At this
time also the lady&rsquo;s husband died, and that was no great
loss, as the lady was far too independent for a wife.&nbsp; Yet,
if the great Kemble had proposed to her, as she used to tell
Fanny Kemble, she would have jumped at him.&nbsp; To the last her
habits of life were most penurious.&nbsp; She spent nothing on
dress, she was indifferent in the matter of eating and drinking,
and when she was making as much as from &pound;500 to &pound;900
by a new play, in order to save a trifle she would sit in the
depth of <!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>winter without a fire.&nbsp; Only
fancy any of our later lady-novelists thus ascetic and
self-denying.&nbsp; The idea is absurd.&nbsp; She was to the last
what Godwin described her, a mixture of lady and milkmaid.&nbsp;
And yet the lady had ambition.&nbsp; She had an idea that she
might be Lady Bunbury.&nbsp; However, she marred her chance, at
the same time missing a rich Mr. Glover, who offered a marriage
settlement of &pound;500 a year.&nbsp; Mrs. Inchbald, however,
well knew how to take care of herself.&nbsp; No one better.&nbsp;
She had learned the art in rather a hard school, and, besides,
she knew how to take care of her poor relations.&nbsp; None of
her sisters seem to have done well, and she had to aid them
all.</p>
<p>Sudbury was the birthplace of that William Enfield, whose
&lsquo;Speaker&rsquo; was the terror and delight of more than one
generation of England&rsquo;s ingenuous youth.&nbsp; Lord
Chancellor Thurlow, of the rugged eyebrows and the savage look,
and fellow-clerk with the poet Cowper, was born at Ashfield, an
obscure village not far off.&nbsp; Robert Bloomfield, who wrote
the &lsquo;Farmer&rsquo;s Boy,&rsquo; came from Honington, where
his mother kept a village school, and where he became a
shoemaker.&nbsp; Capel Loft, an amiable gentleman of literary
sympathies and pursuits, and Bloomfield&rsquo;s warmest friend,
<!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>resided at Troston Hall, in the immediate neighbourhood
of Honington.&nbsp; At one time there was no writer better known
than John Lydgate, called the Monk of Bury, born at the village
of Lydgate, in 1380.&nbsp; &lsquo;His language,&rsquo; writes a
learned critic, &lsquo;is much less obsolete than
Chaucer&rsquo;s, and a great deal more harmonious.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Stephen Gardener, Bishop of Winchester, and an enemy to the
Reformation, was born at Bury.&nbsp; At Trinity St. Martin lived
Thomas Cavendish, the second Englishman who sailed round the
globe.&nbsp; Admiral Broke, memorable for his capture of the
<i>Chesapeake</i>, when we were at war with America, was born at
Nacton.&nbsp; The great non-juring Archbishop Sancroft was born
at Fressingfield, where he retired to die, and where he is buried
under a handsome monument.&nbsp; The great scholar, Robert
Grosset&ecirc;te, Bishop of Lincoln, was born at
Stradbrook.&nbsp; Of him Roger Bacon wrote that he was the only
man living who was in possession of all the sciences.&nbsp;
Wycliff, on innumerable occasions, refers to him with
respect.&nbsp; Arthur Young, the celebrated agriculturist, some
of whose sentences are preserved as golden ones&mdash;especially
that which says, &lsquo;Give a man the secure possession of a
rock, and he will make a garden of it&rsquo;&mdash;and whose
valuable works, I am glad to see, <!-- page 343--><a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>are
republished, was born and lived near Bury St. Edmunds.&nbsp;
Echard, the historian, was born at Barsham, in 1671.&nbsp; Porson
was a Norfolk lad.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Hanmer was one of the most independent men that
ever sat for the county of Suffolk.&nbsp; Mr. Glyde, of Ipswich,
terms him the Gladstone of his age.&nbsp; Pope appears to
stigmatize him as a Trimmer,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Courtiers and patrols in two ranks
divide;<br />
Through both he passed, and bowed from side to side.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His garden at Mildenhall was celebrated for the quality of its
grapes, and Sir Thomas used to send every year hampers filled
with these grapes, and carried on men&rsquo;s shoulders, to
London for the Queen.&nbsp; That stubborn Radical and
Freethinker, Tom Paine, was born at Thetford.&nbsp; Sir John
Suckling, a Suffolk poet, has written, at any rate, one verse
never excelled:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Her feet beneath her petticoat,<br />
Like little mice, stole in and out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if they feared the light.<br />
But oh, she dances such a way,<br />
No sun upon an Easter day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is half so fine a sight.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>England has in all parts of the world sons and daughters who
have deserved well of the State, and not a few of them are East
Anglians by birth <!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>and breeding.&nbsp; May their fame
be cherished and their examples followed by their successors in
that calm, quiet, Eastern land&mdash;far from the madding
crowd&mdash;where the roar and rush of our modern life are almost
unknown&mdash;where farmers weep and wail but look jolly
nevertheless!</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
